**FOCUS QUESTION:** What was daily life like when the First Fleet arrived?

**Focus question image:**
Map of Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, showing ships and settlement details, dated 1788.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask: What was daily life like when the First Fleet
arrived? Invite students to share personal stories or prior knowledge that
connects to living in new or challenging circumstances.

Document students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the
topic and to identify any misconceptions.

Sketch & description of the settlement at Sydney Cove Port Jackson in the County
of Cumberland taken by a transported convict on the 16th of April, 1788, which
was not quite 3 months after Commodore Phillips's landing there [cartographic
material] / F. F. delineavit. Used under Public Domain Guidelines. Mitchell
library, State Library of New South Wales.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to explore what daily life was like when the First Fleet
- arrived in Australia.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify key features of daily life for people in the early colony.
- Use historical sources to gather information about life in the colony.
- Write a clear and detailed description of what daily life was like when the
- First Fleet arrived.

**TEACHER READING:**
Botany Bay versus Port Jackson

Botany Bay was initially chosen for settlement but was found unsuitable due to
poor soil, lack of fresh water and a shallow shoreline. Governor Phillip moved
the colony to Port Jackson, which offered deeper harbours, a more reliable water
source and better land for building.

Daily life in Sydney Cove

When the First Fleet arrived, people lived in makeshift shelters or tents and
had limited supplies, often relying on rations and basic resources. Daily
routines involved food gathering, constructing shelters and managing scarce
materials. This created an environment of shared hardship and adaptability.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What was daily life like when the First Fleet arrived?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students examine the sealed crate and discuss the items inside, imagining they
are original objects from 1788. Encourage them to consider who might have owned
the crate and how each clue reflects aspects of daily life on the First Fleet.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How might the owner of this crate have felt about their journey?

 * What do the objects tell us about what was important to people living in Port
   Jackson at that time?

 * How do these clues help us understand life on the First Fleet?
[Instruction Box] Imagine this crate was found near Sydney Cove, sealed since 1788. Inside are
clues about the first people who arrived with the First Fleet. Click on the
crate to reveal what is inside. 
[Discussion] Who might the crate have belonged to?
[Discussion] What do you think this tells us about life on the First Fleet or at Port
Jackson?
[Discussion] What questions do these objects raise about the early days of the colony?

Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students explore how the First Fleet landed at Botany Bay but soon discovered it
was unsuitable, before finding Port Jackson. Encourage them to identify which
geographical and environmental features made Port Jackson more practical. Ask
students to consider the challenges involved in relocating from Botany Bay to
Port Jackson.
[Statement Box] When the First Fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 18th January 1788, they quickly
realised it wasn’t suitable for a settlement. The soil was too sandy for growing
food, there was no fresh water and the bay was too shallow and exposed. Governor
Phillip explored further north and found Port Jackson, a deep, sheltered harbour
with fresh water and better land.
[Discussion] What features made Port Jackson a better site for settlement than Botany Bay?

[Discussion] What challenges might the First Fleet have faced during the move from Botany Bay
to Port Jackson?
[Instruction Box] This map shows what the coastline looked like between Botany Bay and Broken Bay
when it was first charted by early explorers.
[Plain Text] Ang- is there a way to enhance this image slightly to make it clearer?

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students examine early drawings of Port Jackson and compare how the settlement
changed over time. Encourage them to discuss the living conditions and why tents
and different buildings might have been used. Ask students to interpret the
images to show their understanding of how life in the colony evolved.
[Statement Box] The First Fleet set up camp in Port Jackson on 26th January. Arthur Phillip
named the bay Sydney Cove after Lord Sydney. The area was unfamiliar, the
supplies were low and they had to build everything from scratch.
[Instruction Box] With a partner, examine the early drawings of Port Jackson and talk about
everything that you see.
[Discussion] What differences do you see between the first three images and the last one?
[Discussion] Why do you think there are tents and different types of housing in the last
image?

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students learn how historians use specific search terms to find relevant
information, focusing on who, what and when. Encourage students to look at the
example of vague vs specific terms and discuss why detailed search words lead to
better sources.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] When historians want to find out about the past, they often start by asking a
question. They don't type the whole question into a search bar. They think
carefully: what are the most important words in my question?  These are called
search terms. 
[Table]
+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Example                           | Why it is not effective                                                                    |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Food                              | Too general. It doesn’t tell us who, where or when.                                        |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Convict food                      | Slightly better but still missing time and place.                                          |
+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Convict rations Port Jackson 1788 | Specific. Includes a specific event, place and year. Perfect for finding accurate sources. 
+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[Statement Box] The clearer we make our search terms, the better our results. We want to include
who, what and sometimes when. 

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] Build a search term with a partner using this question: What types of foods did
people eat when they arrived in Port Jackson?
[Discussion] What are the key words in the question?
[Discussion] Who is it about and when?
[Discussion] Talk to your partner about your searchable term.

PART 3:
[Table]
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Historical question                               | Write key words (who, what, when) | Create searchable terms |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| What kind of houses did the convicts build?       |                                   |                         |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| What clothes did convicts wear in the new colony? |                                   |                         |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| How did they get water in the early settlement?   |                                   |                         |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| What jobs did women do in the penal colony?       |                                   |                         
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
[Statement Box] Use a search engine to find out more about one of your searchable terms. Share
your findings with a partner and your class.

Duration: 20 minutes

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students watch a video to learn about how convicts lived at Sydney Cove and the
specific challenges they faced in the settlement. Encourage them to focus on
details that paint a picture of the conditions and daily lives at the time. Ask
students to note three facts and one challenge to show their awareness of key
historical points.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] When we search for information, we can find many different types of sources
including videos. Videos help us to imagine the past. As you watch this, pay
close attention to how convicts lived at Sydney Cove and the challenges they
faced.
[Plain Text] Waiting on video licensing.

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students identify that primary sources such as diaries, drawings and letters are
first-hand evidence from people living at the time. Encourage them to explore
what daily life and routines were really like based on these original accounts
and reflect on any surprising details.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Whilst videos help us imagine the past, primary sources such as diaries,
drawings and letters are real evidence created by people who were actually
there. 
[Instruction Box] Let's look at what people from that time actually said and saw themselves.
[Discussion] What do these sources tell us about daily life and routines?
[Discussion] What surprised you the most?
[Discussion] What were some of the challenges they faced?

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Students consider whether Governor Arthur Phillip should immediately send
convicts and officials to Norfolk Island in February 1788 or wait until Sydney
is better established. Encourage them to balance the potential tree and flax
resources against the risks of a journey over 1000 km away with little safe
landing.

Ask students to write a persuasive paragraph explaining and justifying their
chosen course of action to show critical thinking about colonial priorities.
[Statement Box] It’s February 1788. Governor Arthur Phillip has just set up camp in Sydney Cove.
The British government has ordered him to send people to Norfolk Island, a
remote island believed to have valuable pine trees and flax.
[Table]
+-----------------------+-----------------+
| Reasons to settle now | Reasons to wait |
+-----------------------+-----------------+
|                       |                 |
+-----------------------+-----------------+
|                       |                 
+-----------------------+-----------------+
[Coloured Box] There’s a problem:

 * Norfolk Island is over 1,000km away

 * There’s no safe place to land ships

 * The weather is stormy

 * It will take precious supplies and people away from Sydney

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 9:**
Description: Students imagine they are in charge of improving the settlement at Port Jackson
to ensure it survives its first year. They decide who to bring, what to pack,
and any rules to keep order. Encourage them to explain why certain specialists
or items are essential, and ask them to think about how these choices help solve
real colonial problems.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] In 1788, the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson to start a new colony. But they
faced serious problems:

 * Poor soil for farming

 * Shortage of clean water

 * Not enough tools or food

 * Most convicts didn’t have useful skills

 * Illness spread quickly
[Instruction Box] You are now in charge of redesigning the settlement to help the colony survive
its first year. Think carefully about who you bring, what you need and how you
will solve problems.

PART 2:

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 15 minutes
