**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask, "What events and experiences shaped the journey
of the First Fleet?"

Ask students to connect to their own experiences of travelling to unfamiliar
places and share what they know about historic voyages. Document students'
responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify
any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to describe the events and experiences that shaped the
- journey of the First Fleet.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Describe what life was like for different people on the ships.
- Put important events from the First Fleet’s journey in the correct order.
- Explain how these events and experiences affected the journey.

**TEACHER READING:**
Conditions on the voyage

Those on board lived under cramped, harsh conditions with meagre rations and
very limited sanitation. Social hierarchies and confined quarters often led to
tensions between convicts, officers and marines.

Key stopovers on the journey

Through ports like Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope, the First
Fleet resupplied and carried out essential repairs to ensure survival. These
stops helped maintain health, morale and workable structure for the continued
journey.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What events and experiences shaped the journey of the First Fleet?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe the events and experiences that shaped the journey of the
First Fleet.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students imagine stepping onto a wooden deck on 13 May 1787, reflecting on the
sights, sounds and smells as they depart Portsmouth. Invite them to share with a
partner their thoughts about the uncertain future of the voyage and how
different roles might shape their experience.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What do you notice as you stand on the deck?

 * Which part of the voyage concerns you the most?

 * How might you feel about not knowing what the new land is like?
[Instruction Box] Close your eyes. It’s May 13, 1787. You’re standing on a wooden deck. You’ve
just left Portsmouth, England. You might be a sailor, a convict or a soldier.
The smell of salt is everywhere. You don’t know what the new land will be like
or even if you’ll survive the journey. Let’s step back into history together.
[Discussion] What did you see?
[Discussion] What do you think this voyage will be like?

Description: Students explore an eBook describing each ship of the First Fleet, discovering
why some carried convicts, others carried supplies and some offered protection.
Invite them to note how these different roles supported the overall success of
the fleet.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which ship’s purpose fascinated you most?

 * Why do you think multiple ship types were needed?

 * How might the people on board different ships interact with one another?

PART 1:
[Plain Text] Eleven ships carried over 1,400 people to the unknown. Each ship in the First
Fleet had a role.

Some carried convicts, others supplies and a few were there for protection. 
[Instruction Box] Read the eBook to learn more about each ship and what their purpose was.
[Plain Text] Draft ebook now inserted, Insert edits below

Ang- I have made edits to the actual canva doc because I needed to add licensing
information in underneath each image.  

Page 1- I feel this image is a little dull, is there a way to make this page
more engaging? 

Page 2- text is a little hard to read with the background image. Can this please
be fixed?

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students examine a timeline showing how the First Fleet’s long voyage included
important stops along the way. Suggest they focus on the experiences of people
on board and think about why each stop was needed.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What surprises you about the number of stops the First Fleet made?

 * How do you think these stops affected the people on board?

 * Which event seems most significant to the Fleet’s success?
PART 1:
[Statement Box] The First Fleet didn't just sail straight to Australia. The journey was long and
full of important stops. To understand the experiences of the people on board,
we need to know what happened and when.
[Plain Text] Use the timeline to explore the First Fleet’s journey, stopovers and challenges
on their voyage to Australia.

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students read two journal excerpts by Arthur Bowes Smyth and John Easty to gain
real insight into the First Fleet. Invite them to consider how each writer’s
role may have influenced what they observed and recorded.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What unique details do these journals provide?

 * How might the writers’ backgrounds shape their observations?

 * What could be missing from these accounts?
PART 1:
[Statement Box] We can learn about what people felt and did by reading their journals. Read the
two excerpts by Arthur Bowes Smyth and John Easty. Consider who they were, their
roles on the First Fleet and how this influenced what they wrote.
[Plain Text] Journal excerpts in design- John Easty was previously designed, will redesign to
match new journal.

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students work in pairs, taking turns roleplaying a person from the First Fleet
while the other asks questions. Suggest they draw on details from journal
entries to explore different hopes, fears and day-to-day experiences. Have them
swap roles to demonstrate how well they each understand the diverse perspectives
of these travellers.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which parts of the journey seem most challenging for your character?

 * How might a person’s rank influence their daily life?

 * What new insights did you discover when asking or answering questions?
[Plain Text] With your partner, take turns being a person on the First Fleet. One of you will
ask questions and the other will answer using details from what we’ve learned.
Then swap roles. 
[Statement Box] Reading journal excerpts helps you understand history through real voices; how
people felt, what they feared and what they hoped for. Bringing these voices to
life helps you connect with their experiences.
[Discussion] What was the hardest day?
[Discussion] What happened when the ship stopped?
[Discussion] How did you feel about the officers/convicts?
[Discussion] What happened when the ship stopped at another country?

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students select one person on the First Fleet and imagine that individual’s
daily thoughts and feelings. Encourage them to write or speak in the first
person, explaining duties, worries or hopes that shaped this experience.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How does your chosen role affect daily life on the ship?

 * What hopes or worries might your character have?

 * What details make your character’s story feel believable?
[Statement Box] History is full of different perspectives. People experienced the same journey
in very different ways. Let’s step into their shoes and imagine what they might
say if they could speak to us today.
[Instruction Box] Pick one person from the journey to imagine their thoughts and feelings:

 * A child convict

 * A ship captain

 * A soldier

 * A nurse
[Instruction Box] Example: I am a marine. I think it’s my duty to keep order but it’s not easy. I
feel tense because the convicts are restless and the journey is long.

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Students think about being allowed to pack six items for the First Fleet voyage,
choosing a role and explaining why each item is important. Suggest they connect
their decisions to real conditions on the ships, such as limited space or
uncertain provisions. Ask them to remove one item and discuss how this changes
their priorities, encouraging deeper reflection on survival.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How does your character’s role affect what you pack?

 * Which item would be the hardest to leave behind?

 * How does giving up one item change your understanding of a long voyage?

Description: Students imagine an alternate scenario where the First Fleet never departs or
turns back partway, then use the cause and effect T-chart to show likely
outcomes. Encourage them to consider impacts on the people on board, the British
government and First Nations communities in Australia.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How might daily life change for those expecting to sail?

 * What would this mean for First Nations Australians?

 * Which potential long-term consequences stand out most to you?
[Plain Text] Imagine the First Fleet never left England or turned back halfway. What might
have happened to the people on board? What might have happened in Australia
instead?
