**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will explore historical trade connections and cultural practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Students are introduced to these concepts through structured opportunities to investigate how trade routes and exchanges influenced adaptation, problem solving and the sharing of knowledge and ideas. Students will demonstrate their understanding by creating a written text that explains how these practices shaped the lives and cultures of First Nations People.  
 The HASS Concepts integrated in this lesson include:  Significance  Interconnections  
 The related content includes the ACARA 9.0 English outcome:  Listen for key points and information to carry out tasks and contribute to discussions, acknowledging another opinion, linking a response to the topic, and sharing and extending ideas and information. (AC9E4LY02)

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question:

 * How did trade and the exchange of ideas shape the lives and cultures of First
   Nations Peoples?

Ask students to look for clues from the image and ask:

 * How could trade have happened?

 * Where did this trade occur?

 * What might have been traded?
   
   

Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Explain how trade and the exchange of ideas shaped the lives and cultures of
- First Nations People.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- Define the term 'trade'.
- Investigate trade partnerships between different First Nations People.
- Create a written text to explain the influence of trade and the exchange of
- ideas on the lives and cultures of First Nations People.

**TEACHER READING:**
First Nations People have a deep history of trading goods and ideas for
thousands of years. Trade networks were not restricted to a single region, as
different nations and clans negotiated exchanges to gain items they could not
source locally.

Macassan traders travelled from what is now Indonesia to northern Australia,
bringing with them goods such as metal tools to trade for trepang (sea
cucumber). This contact introduced new materials and cultural influences that
shaped some communities in this region.

Across the continent, a variety of items were valued for trade, such as ochre,
shells, baskets and spears. Each region provided resources unique to its
environment.

Rock art across Australia gives a glimpse of cultural connections and trade
exchanges. You can see depictions of different animals, unfamiliar vessels and
objects that were not from that area.

Trade was more than the movement of objects. It included the sharing of ideas,
stories and skills. You can observe how this exchange expanded cultural
practices, enriched languages and fostered alliances.

As trade resources spread, communities benefitted from improved tools, broader
diets and enhanced social connections. This exchange influenced everything from
technology to art, offering insight into how First Nations Peoples thrived
through collaboration and innovation.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How did trade and the exchange of ideas shape the lives and cultures of First
   Nations People?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to explain how trade and the exchange of ideas shaped the lives and
cultures of First Nations People.

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Present the animation and use the focus questions to lead a discussion around
the image and what information it provides.

Image used is a photograph of a prau (Macassan boat) from Djulirri that is found
underneath beeswax pellets forming a female human figure. Radiocarbon analyses
of the beeswax on top of the boat figure showed that the prau was painted in the
late 1770s. Photo by Paul S.C. Taçon.
[Instruction Box] Press the 'reveal' button to watch this rock painting come to life. What can
rock paintings tell us about the past? 
[Discussion] What information can it give us about the history of the First Nations People of
Australia?
[Discussion] Why might they have painted it?
[Discussion] Who do you think might have painted this image?

   goods and ideas?
[Statement Box] Trade is the activity of buying and selling, or the exchange of goods and
ideas. First Nations People were involved in trade for thousands of years,
exchanging both goods and knowledge.

First Nations trader or a Macassan sailor. Write a short story or diary entry
about a day in your life.

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Read the instructions and highlight the objective of the game. Draw attention to
the fact that the counters represent different items traded by First Nations
People. Show them the uneven distribution of coloured counters and highlight
real-life scarcity of certain resources.

Note: Before the game begins, you will need to ensure that there are adequate
amounts of counters for the number of players and also ensure an uneven number
of counters to replicate the real life situation.
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] It's your turn to try out your trading skills! Follow the steps to create, play
and reflect on a Trade Exchange Game. Your objective is to try to collect a
complete set of different trade items without exchanging any money.
[Plain Text] Step 1: Collect Counters

Take 10 coloured counters from a central container. Each colour stands for a
different item traded by First Nations People. There is an uneven amount of each
colour in the container, so some items will be in short supply. 

Red counters = ochre

Blue counters  = shells

Green counters  = baskets

Black counters  = tools and spears

Yellow counters = canoes
[Image] Collage features a handprint, colourful discs, shells, a canoe, arrows, and a woven object.

PART 2:
[Plain Text] Step 4: Trade! - You have ten minutes to try and complete your set. 

PART 3:

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 25 minutes
