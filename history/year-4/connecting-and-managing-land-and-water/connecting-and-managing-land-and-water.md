**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question:

 * How do First Nations Peoples connect with and manage land and water?

Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Explain how First Nations People connect to and manage land and water.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson students will:
- Describe the connection First Nations People have to land and water.
- Explain how First Nations People manage land and water.
- Uses the provided sources to investigate and gather information.

**TEACHER READING:**
First Nations Peoples view Country as part of their identity. Country includes
land, water, sky and all living things. It is a source of family ties, culture
and spirituality, carrying responsibilities to care for and be cared for by the
environment.

Custodians are those who protect, manage and sustain important things such as
land, culture and traditions. First Nations Peoples are Custodians who view
their role as protectors and guardians of Country, preserving it for future
generations.

Knowledge Holders are people who hold and share information passed down through
generations. First Nations Elders and community members pass on stories,
practices and cultural wisdom, enabling younger generations to continue
important traditions.

Cultural burning (also called cool burning) involves small, carefully managed
fires. These burns clear undergrowth, support regeneration and maintain
habitats. They are guided by connection to and observation of the land,
tradition and respect for the local environment.

Reading the environment involves watching for natural signs to know when and how
to care for Country. First Nations Peoples observe plant growth, water levels,
animal behaviour and weather patterns to guide decisions about land and water
management.

Seasonal calendars highlight changes in weather, plant growth and animal
activity. First Nations communities have diverse calendars reflecting local
conditions. By following these calendars, they know when to gather food, conduct
burns and protect resources.

Please note this lesson contains the name of a deceased First Nations person.

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: As a class, read through the cultural burning infographic and point out why
these fires are also known as cool burns, used for over 60 000 years.

Cultural burns are small, managed fires that help reduce intense blazes while
preserving and renewing vegetation.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What surprised you the most about these small, cool fires?

 * Why might it be important to maintain this cultural practice today?
[Instruction Box] With your teacher, read the infographic to learn more about cultural burning.
[Image] The slow, cool fire stays low to the ground as it moves through the landscape. The canopy remains untouched by the flames, preserving the upper forest structure. These fires are self-extinguishing, which prevents uncontrolled spread across larger areas. Animals and insects have sufficient time to escape the approaching fire front. The cooler temperatures do not ignite volatile tree oils, which helps protect the bark from serious damage. Young trees survive the controlled burning, ensuring forest regeneration continues uninterrupted. Grass seeds remain intact within the soil, allowing for rapid regrowth after the fire passes. The fire's moderate intensity preserves soil nutrients and established root systems, maintaining overall ecosystem health.

[Statement Box] First Nations Peoples have used cultural burning, also known as 'cool burning',
for over 60 000 years to connect with and manage the land. These small, gentle
fires help keep Country, and all living things on it, healthy.

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Watch We Read the Country to learn about cultural burning from a Knowledge
Holder.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Why do you think timing is so important in cultural burning?

 * How do you imagine changing factors like temperature and wind affect a burn?

 * How can reading the land and its conditions ensure cool burns are effective?

 * What might happen if a burn is carried out at the wrong time?
[Statement Box] Cultural burning occurs in the early dry season (April–July), with timing based
on the ecosystem. Trained fire practitioners assess the land to determine the
best conditions. This method creates patches of burnt and unburnt areas, helping
to reduce bushfire spread and intensity.

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Guide students to use conjunctions such as ‘because’ and ‘so’ to explain how
First Nations People practise cultural burning to connect with and manage the
land.

Conjunctions are important for showing connections, causes and their effects.

Use the first sentence as a model to explain to the students how the activity
will work.

As a class, complete the second sentence using the conjunction because.

Students can complete the final two sentences with a partner.
[Statement Box] First with your teacher, and then a partner, use conjunctions to explain how
First Nations People use cultural burning to connect to and manage the land.
[Statement Box] Because explains why something is true. 
[Statement Box] So tells us what happens as the result of something else.

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Students observe Holly Sanders’ Saltwater Country artwork and reflect on how the
depiction of water sources links to sustaining life. Prompt them to notice
details that indicate the flow of water and ways it nurtures plants, animals and
people.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How does water in the artwork help different living things thrive?

 * Why do you think the artist highlights natural elements like middens and bush
   tucker?
[Plain Text] Just as fire brings new life, water is essential to sustain life and is sacred
to First Nations People. Knowing where to find water was, and still is, very
important for survival. Artworks by First Nations People show their connection
to and management of water. 
[Instruction Box] With a partner, view the artwork Saltwater Country by Holly Sanders, then answer
the questions. 
[Discussion] How does water sustain life and for whom?
[Discussion] Track the water patterns in the artwork. How does it reflect how water moves? 
[Image] Saltwater Country shows how First Nations People connect to country through artwork. It highlights middens, bush tucker, berries, blossoms, seeds and pippies in sand, saltwater, ocean and bushland environments.

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Examine the Bureau of Meteorology’s (BOM) partnership with First Nations groups
and discover how Knowledge Holders share environmental observations.

Access the calendar via the google search link provided. Select Yirrganydji on
the interactive map, located in northern Queensland.

Read the Yirrganydji seasonal calendar and identify how each season can inform
decision-making about water and land management.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How might working together with Knowledge Holders benefit the way we manage
   resources?
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has partnered with First Nations groups across
Australia, learning from their Elders and Knowledge Holders about how they
observe natural signs in the environment and use them to manage land and
water. This knowledge is shared through storytelling and seasonal calendars.
[Instruction Box] With your teacher, use the google link to access the BOM's Indigenous Weather

PART 3:
[Instruction Box] This information can then be used to write an explanation about how
the Yirrganydji People manage land and water. With your teacher, read the model
text that highlights the features of an explanation. 
[Plain Text] The Yirrganydji seasonal calendar is an important guide that shows how the First
Nations People of Yirrganydji connect to and manage their land and water. 

During the dry season, the weather is cool, and certain plants and animals
respond to these conditions. One example is the availability of berries, which
are ready for picking at this time. By observing these natural signs, the
Yirrganydji people know when to gather food, helping to manage the balance of
the environment.

By understanding seasonal changes, the People of Yirrganydji care for and manage
their land and water, to live in harmony with the environment and protect it for
future generations.
