**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question:

 * What can we learn from the history of First Nations People?

Focus on the image and ask what story they think it might tell.

Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Investigate archaeological sites and explain the continuous connection and
- early lifestyles of First Nations People.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Consider the importance of archaeological evidence from different
- perspectives.
- Recall facts about different archaeological sites and identify similarities
- and differences between them.
- Demonstrate their knowledge by planning an explanation text about the
- importance of archaeological sites in First Nations People history.

**TEACHER READING:**
First Nations People have lived across Australia for at least 65 000 years. This
continuous presence reflects the deep cultural, spiritual and environmental
connections that have been maintained over millennia.

Archaeologists examine soil, artefacts and other physical evidence to learn
about how people lived. Their discoveries help reconstruct timelines and expand
our understanding of history.

Ancient footprints, such as those discovered in Mungo National Park, show
evidence of human activity and movement. These traces reveal daily life and help
you appreciate the continuous occupation of Country by First Nations People.

Megafauna once roamed the Australian landscape alongside First Nations People.
Sites like Cuddie Springs show that humans and giant animals shared the
environment, although there is ongoing debate about whether these animals were
hunted.

Grinding stones indicate advanced skills in food preparation and toolmaking.
First Nations People used them for tasks such as grinding seeds, cracking bones
for marrow and sharpening tools.

Historical knowledge can come from scientific research or from Dreaming stories
passed down through generations. Both methods offer unique insights into the
origins and heritage of First Nations People.

Historical sites provide evidence of complex ways of living and adapting to
changing environments. Studying them broadens your understanding of how First
Nations People thrived across diverse landscapes for tens of thousands of years.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What can we learn from the history of First Nations Peoples?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Read the information at the top of the slide, emphasising the importance of
archaeological sites and what can then be done with the information that is
acquired. Use the focus questions to guide students as they identify what
evidence was uncovered at Nauwalabila and what this evidence reveals.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What do you think this discovery tells us about how people lived long ago?

 * Which artefacts help us understand the past in this location?
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Archaeological sites provide us with information about the past. We might learn
how old something is, or discover the way people lived. We can use factual
information to write historical explanations, by taking one piece of evidence
from the past and showing what we learn from it. Look at this example.
[Plain Text] At Nauwalabila, archaeologists found stone tools and spear points.
[Plain Text] What can we learn from this evidence?
[Plain Text] First Nations People were skilled at making their own tools for hunting and
preparing food. 
[Plain Text] What evidence did archaeologists find?
[Image] Two stones on a light background; one has carvings, the other is smooth and unmarked.
[Image] Aboriginal grinding hollows, historically used for food preparation, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia

PART 2:
[Coloured Box] We can use this information to create one sentence that explains something about
the way of life of First Nations People from thousands of years ago. 
[Speech Bubble] Archaeologists found stone tools and spear points at Nauwalabila, so this means
that the First Nations People who lived in that area were skilled at making
their own tools for hunting and preparing food. 
[Image] A collection of six stones displayed on a flat surface, some with markings.

PART 3:
[Instruction Box] Use the information provided in Sites Of Country to finish these explanatory

Duration: 20 minutes
Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to investigate archaeological sites and explain the continuous
connection and early lifestyles of First Nations People.

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Present students with the intriguing idea that archaeologists do not have all
the answers about life in the past and that some discoveries remain mysterious.
Look at the images provided and read the mystery question. Encourage students to
share some initial thoughts.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Sometimes, archaeologists uncover bones and artefacts that don't present a clear
answer about life in the past. Some of these mysteries are still unsolved and
scientists are working to find an answer. 
[Plain Text] Mystery! Did First Nations People once hunt dinosaurs, or did they just live
near them? 

Use the information on the next slide to help you make your decision.

[Image] Artist's illustration of a prehistoric bird, Genyornis, with a slender neck and grey plumage.

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] Read the information to learn about Cuddie Springs and what was discovered
there. 
[Table]
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Where is this site located?         | Cuddie Springs is near Brewarrina, in central northern New South Wales, on the lands of the Wailwan People. It is in an ancient lake bed that can fill with water after heavy rain. |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| How did the landscape change?       | During dry times, the lake shrank, attracting animals looking for water. Over time, their bones became buried in the lakebed.                                                       |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| What was discovered?                | Scientists found unmarked bones of giant extinct animals (megafauna) and stone tools in the same soil layers. They also found grinding stones used by First Nations People.         |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| What were grinding stones used for? | Grinding stones were used to grind seeds into flour for making bread, crack animal bones for marrow, grind pigments like ochre, and sharpen tools.                                  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Why are they important?             | Grinding stones show that First Nations People had advanced food preparation skills and adapted to different environments.                                                          |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| What does the evidence suggest?     | The site provides strong evidence that humans coexisted with megafauna about 30 000 – 36 000 years ago.                                                                             
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

PART 3:
[Instruction Box] Imagine you are an archaeologist investigating Cuddie Springs. Your job is to
examine the evidence and decide whether First Nations People hunted megafauna or
simply lived alongside them. Think about the discoveries that were made and what
they showed. Was there any proof of hunting?

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 25 minutes

**ACTIVITY 9:**
Description: Present students with the two different methods of telling the history of First
Nations Peoples: scientific inquiry and the Dreaming, guiding them to weigh the
strengths of each.

Encourage them to discuss what unique information each method provides,
prompting them to consider whether it is more valuable to use both or just one.

Ask them to justify their stance with clear reasons, demonstrating their ability
to evaluate multiple perspectives on the telling of history.

Additional prompting questions could include:

 * How does the scientific approach help us uncover evidence from ancient times?

 * What deeper insights can we gain from cultural stories passed through
   generations of First Nations Peoples?

 * Do you think combining both approaches offers a more complete understanding,
   or is it best to rely on one method alone?
[Statement Box] The history of First Nations People can be told using two different methods. 
[Plain Text] Scientific - examining evidence from scientists and archaeologists.
[Plain Text] Dreaming - examining cultural stories passed down by generations of First
Nations People. 

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 10 minutes
