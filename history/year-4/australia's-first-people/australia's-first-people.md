**TEACHER READING:**
Australia’s original inhabitants are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Peoples, who are collectively referred to as First Nations People. These two
distinct cultural groups are the Knowledge Holders and Custodians of more than
60 000 years of continuous culture and traditions.

Aboriginal Peoples have diverse cultures, languages, laws and traditions that
reflect their deep connections to the land.

Torres Strait Islander Peoples inhabit the islands between northern Queensland
and Papua New Guinea. They have customs, cultures and languages that differ from
Aboriginal Peoples. Their maritime environment, including navigation and fishing
practices, influences their traditions and way of life.

The two flags of Aboriginal Peoples and Torres Strait Islander Peoples symbolise
distinct identities, histories and cultures. Each flag has specific colours and
symbols to represent cultural beliefs and ties to Country.
