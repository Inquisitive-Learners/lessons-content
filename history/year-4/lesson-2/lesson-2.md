**Lesson ID:** 5753

**Lesson name:** Lesson 2

**Lesson duration:** 60 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Were the crimes worth the punishment?

**Focus question image:**
Three men in 18th-century attire sit contemplatively by a dock, with ships in the background.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask: “Were the crimes worth the punishment?”

Ask students to think about any examples they have heard of from the 1700s where
people received harsh penalties. Encourage students to share personal
reflections about fairness in society.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to describe past crimes and punishments from a historical
- perspective.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Describe what the crime was and what punishment was given.
- Explain how people at the time may have seen the crime and punishment.
- Describe how different people might see the same event in different ways.

**TEACHER READING:**
Crimes in 1700s Britain

In the 1700s, many people committed minor thefts out of desperation. Society
often blamed poverty on individuals, which led to severe repercussions even for
small crimes.

Harsh punishments

Authorities believed strict measures, such as transportation, were necessary to
deter future crimes. This harsh approach often did not consider broader social
circumstances that drove people to crime.

Experiences of convicts

Convicts usually endured crowded, unsanitary ship conditions and faced total
uncertainty once they arrived. Many never returned home and felt profound
isolation from their families and former lives.

Perspective in history

Different people at the time experienced events in drastically different ways
depending on their social status or role. By recognising diverse viewpoints, you
can better understand how attitudes toward crime and punishment shaped
individual experiences.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Were the crimes worth the punishment?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe past crimes and punishments from a historical perspective.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students adopt the fictional identities from their boarding passes to explore
life on the First Fleet. Encourage them to discuss with a partner how their
characters ended up on the voyage and what hopes or fears they have.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What details from your boarding pass stand out to you?

 * How do you think your character feels about this journey?
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] Welcome aboard the First Fleet! You’ve each got a new identity. Some of you
chose this journey and some of you didn’t. Let’s find out what your life might
have been like.
[Instruction Box] Give each student a 'boarding pass' with a fictionalised identity. Ask them to
introduce themselves briefly in role to a partner.

[Plain Text] Alex- I feel there are too many AI images in this lesson now... can this be
changed please?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students think, pair, share about the harsh punishments given for minor crimes
in the 1700s. Encourage them to compare those historical attitudes to modern
views on poverty and desperation.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What do you think led people to commit crimes when they were poor?

 * How is poverty viewed differently today?
[Instruction Box] Think, pair, share these questions with your partner.
[Discussion] Why do you think these small crimes were punished so harshly?
[Discussion] If someone stole food today because they were hungry, what do you think would
happen?
[Statement Box] These quotes show us that poverty wasn’t just seen as unfortunate, it was often
blamed on the person. Being poor was treated like a personal failure, not
something caused by bigger problems in society. 
[Instruction Box] In the 1700s, cities were packed with people struggling to survive, especially
the poor. Some begged, some stole and some just disappeared from sight. 
[Coloured Box] Poverty is no excuse.
[Coloured Box] The poor steal because they are idle.

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students look at images of people in desperate circumstances and discuss whether
their actions are for survival or are criminal. Encourage them to consider how
society in the 1700s blamed poverty on individuals.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What details suggest people acted out of survival?

 * Would you think differently if you knew more about what their life was like?
[Discussion] If people in the 1700s believed poverty was your own fault, what happened when
poor people had to make tough choices? Look at the images below and discuss
whether you think this is survival or a crime.

[Plain Text] Ang- I feel like these are a little too 'enhanced'. May you please have another
go so they don't look too overdone? Sorry unsure how to explain that any
better.

Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students collaborate to match each 1700s crime with its punishment and consider
whether it fits. Have them present their pairs to justify why punishments seem
severe or reasonable.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which punishment surprised you the most?

 * How do you think money or status changed the outcome?

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students watch the Sentenced to Sail video to learn about the experiences of
convicts and the impact of forced transportation. Encourage them to notice
conditions on the ships and how sentencing disrupted families.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What conditions stood out to you in the video?

 * How might transportation have affected people’s futures?
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] Watch the video Sentenced to Sail to learn more about the lives of convicts in
the 1700s and what happened to them after they were sentenced.
[Plain Text] Video on trello card, Mackenzie to add video links in.

Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students explore different perspectives by imagining how people such as a
shopkeeper, a judge or a hungry mother would react to a crime. Encourage them to
discuss each person’s feelings and how their background might influence their
view. Have them compare two perspectives to show that viewpoint shapes
understanding.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which person’s viewpoint seems hardest to empathise with?

 * How does each person’s background affect their feelings?
PART 1:
[Plain Text] An important history skill is called perspective. That means thinking about how
someone else saw or experienced an event. In history, two people might go
through the same thing but have completely different thoughts or feelings about
it.
[Plain Text] Imagine a poor woman in London steals a loaf of bread to feed her hungry
children. A wealthy shopkeeper catches her and calls the police. She is
sentenced to 7 years transportation to Australia.

How would each of these people feel about what happened?

 * The poor woman

 * The shopkeeper

 * The judge

 * A police officer watching

 * The poor woman's child. 
[Plain Text] Turn to a partner and discuss how two different people from the list might feel.

Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Students read the model text to identify first-person voice, emotive language,
imagery and historical authenticity. Encourage them to notice how these features
convey life in the 1700s and show the writer’s emotional state.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which emotive words make the text more powerful?

 * How does the historical voice differ from modern language?
[Statement Box] When we write from a person’s perspective, we want to use certain language
features to make it more vivid and convincing.
[Instruction Box] First-person voice – ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’ — because we’re stepping into someone’s
shoes

Emotive language – to show how the person is feeling: terrified, ashamed,
desperate, angry

Imagery– what they might see, hear or feel: ‘the clank of chains’, ‘the salty
air’, ‘my heart pounding’

Historical voice – not modern slang; keep it believable for the 1700s–1800s
[Plain Text] I never meant to steal it, I just wanted to feel something soft for once in my
life. The judge didn’t care that I was cold or hungry. They said “seven years’
transportation” like it meant nothing at all. Now I sit in the hold of a ship
that reeks of sickness and salt, with chains biting into my wrists. I don’t know
what waits for me in Australia, but I know I’ll never see my mum again.
[Instruction Box] With a partner, read the modelled text and discuss the language features you
notice. 
[Image] Two men and a boy look shocked as a boy holds a loaf of bread in a rustic street.
[Plain Text] Ang- This image needs to be looked at as well please.

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Students write a letter in first-person voice as someone sentenced to
transportation, focusing on emotive language and historical details. Encourage
them to explore the crime, the court experience, and their feelings about what
lies ahead. Ask students to structure their writing in clear paragraphs to
reflect their thoughts, fears and hopes.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How do you capture both fear and uncertainty in your letter?

 * Which historical details help place the reader in the 1700s?
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] Using the skills of emotive language and historical voice, write a letter from
the perspective of someone who has just been sentenced to transportation. The
letter should reflect on the crime, the court experience and the emotions
surrounding what lies ahead.
[Coloured Box] Remember to include:

 * First person voice (e.g. I, my, me)

 * Include emotive language to show thoughts and feelings

 * Historically accurate wording (no modern slang or casual phrasing)

 * Reflect on the sentencing moment and its impact

 * Write in clear paragraphs
[Coloured Box] Useful sentence starters:

 * The judge’s words still echo in my mind...

 * I never thought taking ____ would lead to this...

 * They didn’t ask me why, only what I did...

 * I don’t know where I’ll go, or if I’ll come back...

 * If this is the last letter I ever write...
[Coloured Box] Structure:

 * Who was the letter is to and why?

 * What happened in court?

 * What were their feelings about the sentence?

 * What fears or hopes did they have about the future?

Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe past crimes and punishments from a historical perspective.

**ACTIVITY 9:**
Description: Students take on the role of a 1700s judge reviewing Sarah Bellamy’s theft and
seven-year transportation sentence. Encourage them to weigh Sarah’s
circumstances, including her age, reasons and previous record, as they decide
whether to uphold or reduce the punishment.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which details of Sarah’s life are most important when deciding her fate?

 * Why might some judges have shown little sympathy in these cases?
[Statement Box] Imagine you are a judge in the 1700s.

Your job is to review the convict case below and decide if the punishment was
fair for the time. 
[Coloured Box] CONVICT CASE FILE: SARAH BELLAMY

 * Age: 17

 * Year: 1786

 * Crime: Stole a cotton dress and two handkerchiefs from a market stall

 * Reason: Said she took them to sell for food as her family hadn’t eaten
   properly in days

 * Criminal Record: No previous offences

 * Trial Outcome: Found guilty

 * Punishment: Sentenced to 7 years transportation
[Image] A hand writes with a quill on parchment, surrounded by ink pots and a gavel.

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.

**ACTIVITY 10:**
Description: Students imagine a fairer justice system in the 1700s, creating punishments that
balance consequences with empathy. Encourage them to consider ways to treat
people with compassion while preventing crime, especially for children and those
living in poverty.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Why is fairness important when deciding on punishments?

 * Which preventative strategies might stop crime before it begins?
[Statement Box] Transportation was often seen as a solution to crime, but not everyone agreed it
was fair. Now it’s time to think differently. Imagine going back in time and
designing a justice system that aims to be more balanced.

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
