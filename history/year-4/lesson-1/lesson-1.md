**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask: “Who and what set the First Fleet in motion?”
Encourage them to connect their knowledge of exploration and early British plans
for a new colony by drawing on any historical figures or events they know.
Document and use students’ responses to gauge their current understanding of the
topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to describe the events leading to the First Fleet's
- establishment and its key figures.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Describe key events that led to the First Fleet being sent to Australia.
- Identify and describe the roles of important people involved in planning or
- leading the First Fleet.

**TEACHER READING:**
Overcrowded British prisons

In the late 1700s, Britain’s prisons were overflowing due to rising crime and a
lack of facilities. Recognise that this crisis led officials to seek bold new
options for dealing with convicts.

Britain’s decision to send convicts to Australia

After the American colonies were no longer an option, the British Government
looked to Australia as a potential penal colony. Reasons behind this decision
ranged from political advantages to the hope of relieving overcrowded prisons.

Prison hulks

Old naval vessels were converted into makeshift jails, resulting in appalling
conditions and frequent outbreaks of disease. Understanding this helps explain
why sending convicts to a distant land seemed a more stable solution than
relying on unsafe prison ships.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Who and what set the First Fleet in motion?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe the events leading to the First Fleet's establishment and
its key figures.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students discuss potential solutions for Britain’s overcrowded prisons with
their group, such as building more prisons or sending convicts elsewhere.
Encourage them to compare different ideas and consider how these decisions might
affect the success of establishing the first colony.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which idea do you think would best solve the problem?

 * How might these solutions affect the people involved?

 * What risks or benefits do you see in your chosen plan?
[Instruction Box] It's 1786 and Britain needs a solution because the prisons are overcrowded. The
King has given Lord Viscount Sydney the task of solving this problem, what
should he do?
[Instruction Box] In your group, discuss the following questions:

 * Would you build more prisons?

 * Would you send them somewhere else?

 * What challenges might there be in setting up a colony in an unknown land?

Share your groups thoughts with the class.

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students investigate the reasons for establishing a new colony in Australia when
America was no longer an option. Invite them to weigh up which reasons might
matter most to the British government and reflect on issues of fairness.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How do you decide which reason is the strongest?

 * Why might some people view these reasons as unfair?

 * What evidence can you find that supports your view?
[Plain Text] After Britain was no longer able to send convicts to America, Lord Viscount
Sydney was given the task of building a new colony in Australia.
[Discussion] Which of these reasons do you think was most important to the British
Government?
[Discussion] Which reasons feel fair or unfair to you? Why?

Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students read the eBook about prison hulks and examine the conditions convicts
faced on these ships. Encourage them to compare ideas about punishment and
survival, and think about how these experiences shaped convict attitudes.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What do you think life was like day-to-day on a prison hulk?

 * How might these conditions affect a person’s outlook on their future?

 * Would you feel hopeful or hopeless in that situation?
[Statement Box] One solution the government thought of to solve the overcrowding in the prisons
was to use ex-Navy ships. They transformed the hulks into prisons. 
[Instruction Box] Read the eBook to learn more about Prison Hulks and discuss the questions with
your partner. 
[E-book] Prison Hulks
[Discussion] Would you describe life on a hulk as punishment or survival?
[Discussion] How might this experience have shaped a convict’s feelings before the voyage?

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students learn about the government’s decision to establish a penal colony in
Australia after realising the problems with prison hulks. Invite them to
consider which figures would be needed to put Lord Sydney’s plan into action and
why they might be chosen. Students can discuss their prior knowledge of these
people with a partner to reflect on how these historical figures influenced
colonisation.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * How do you think these key people felt about being chosen?

 * Why might certain skills or expertise be important when setting up a new
   colony?
[Statement Box] The British Government soon saw that prison hulks were overcrowded, dirty and
unsafe with many prisoners becoming sick and dying. In 1786, Thomas Townshend,
Lord Sydney, approved a plan to send convicts to a new penal colony in
Australia. Several key figures were chosen to help carry out this plan.
[Discussion] What do you already know about these important people? Talk about your ideas
with a partner.

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students read the fact file to gather key information about Arthur Phillip’s
leadership and his role in founding the new colony. Encourage them to consider
his responsibilities as governor and why he might have accepted this challenging
position. Ask them to discuss the obstacles he might have faced.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What qualities do you notice in Arthur Phillip’s preparation for leading the
   colony?

 * How might he have felt about the unknown challenges in Australia?

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students explore a modelled description of Arthur Phillip, identifying the
features used to build a clear picture of his life and leadership. Invite them
to notice how factual details and personal qualities combine to show his
character and impact on Australia’s early history.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Which parts of the description stand out to you?

 * Wow is factual information woven into the description of his character?

 * What details might you include for a different key figure?
[Plain Text] Arthur Phillip was the first Governor of New South Wales and the leader of the
First Fleet. He was born in England in 1738 and became a skilled sailor in the
British navy. He was known for being calm, smart and a strong leader.

In 1787, Phillip was chosen to lead the First Fleet to Australia. The journey
took over eight months and he worked hard to keep everyone safe. When they
arrived in 1788, he helped set up the first European settlement in Sydney Cove.

Phillip tried to treat people fairly, including the First Nations people of
Australia and faced many challenges like food shortages and illness. He is
remembered as someone who helped shape the beginning of modern Australia.
[Instruction Box] Information from a fact file can also be used to write a description about key
people. As a class, read the modelled text that highlights the features of a
description.
