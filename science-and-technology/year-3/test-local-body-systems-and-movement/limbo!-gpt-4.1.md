## Focus Question

**How can we find out who is the best at limbo?**

---

## 1. Learning Intention

> Students will be able to:
> - Answer a scientific question by carrying out an experiment.

## 2. Success Criteria

> By the end of this lesson, students will:
> - Identify a scientific question.
> - Follow steps to carry out an experiment.
> - Take measurements and record these on a table.
> - Draw conclusions from the results of an experiment.

## 3. Teacher Reading

> A scientific investigation involves asking a question that can be tested, making a prediction, conducting an experiment, and drawing conclusions based on the results. A fair test means changing only one variable at a time while keeping all other conditions the same. This ensures that the results are due to the variable being tested, allowing for accurate conclusions. It should be noted that the use of the term 'variable' is not required at this year level.

## 4. Note

> **Vocabulary Words**  
> The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

### SECTION 2: Identifying Scientific Questions  
- **Teacher-Led Activity**

*Teaching Note: Introduce the concept of scientific questions—questions that can be answered through investigation or experimentation. As a class, read five questions and decide which are scientific.*

> "A **scientific question** is one that can be answered through doing an investigation or an experiment."

#### Multiple Choice Activity  
**Instruction:** Which of these are scientific questions? You can select more than one.  

- When did you start limboing?
- Who inspired you to start limboing?
- **What is the best clothing to wear for limboing?** ✅
- How do you prepare for breaking a record?
- **Are people with shorter bones in their lower legs better at limbo?** ✅

*Correct Answers:*
- What is the best clothing to wear for limboing?
- Are people with shorter bones in their lower legs better at limbo?

*Teaching Note: You may also like to draw students' attention to the image of a child attempting limbo.*

### SECTION 3: Planning and Conducting the Experiment

#### a. Pose the Scientific Question
*Teaching Note: Explain to students that they are going to investigate the question: Are people with shorter bones in their lower legs better at limbo?*

#### b. Materials Needed
- Each group of five will need:
    - 1 skipping rope or piece of string
    - 2 metre rulers
    - 1 measuring tape
    - The results table in Activity 4
- **Image alt text:** *Two wooden rulers, a blue skipping rope, and a flexible measuring tape on a white background.*

#### c. Measuring Lower Leg Bones
*Teaching Note: Organise students into groups of five and provide each group with a tape measure. Model and support students in measuring each person’s lower leg bone using the image for guidance.*

**Steps:**
- Student A sits on a chair.
- Student A finds 0 cm on the tape measure and holds it where their knee bends, letting the rest hang.
- Student B finds where the tape measure reaches student A’s ankle and reads the measurement.

**Image alt text:** *A child measures another child's leg while seated in a classroom setting.*

*Students complete the first three columns of the results table in Activity 4.*

### SECTION 4: Aim, Prediction, and Fair Testing

#### a. Write Aim & Prediction

**Instructions for Students:**
- **My aim:** (This is the reason why we are conducting the experiment)  
  - Example: "I want to find out if people with a shorter lower leg bone are better at the limbo."
- **My prediction:** (This is a best guess of what you think will happen in the experiment)  
  - Example: "I predict that people with a shorter lower leg bone will be better at the limbo."

#### b. Fair Test Discussion

- **Instruction box:** Make sure your experiment is a fair test.
- Statement:  
  "When conducting an experiment, scientists make sure that it is a fair test by only changing one thing."

#### c. Multiple Choice (Fair Test)  
**Question:** What is the only thing you will change in your experiment to make sure that it is a fair test?
- The limboing rules
- The skipping rope we use
- **The length of people's lower leg bones** ✅
- The number of attempts people will have at each limbo height

*Correct Answer:* The length of people's lower leg bones.

#### d. Begin the Experiment  
**Instruction box:** Now you are ready to carry out the experiment.

### SECTION 5: Steps for Conducting the Experiment

#### a. Sequence of Steps (with Images)
- **Step instruction:** Read through the steps to find out how to conduct your experiment.
- First, use the tape measure to measure everyone’s lower leg bones.
    - **Image alt text:** *A child measures another child's leg while seated in a classroom setting.*
- Next, fill out the first three columns in the results table in Activity 4.

#### b. Set Up and Conduct

- Prepare the limbo: Two people hold a 1-metre ruler; two others hold either end of the skipping rope at a height of 1 metre.
    - **Image alt text:** *Four children measuring one metre with a tape measure in a grassy field.*
- Take turns to go under the limbo. If you touch the skipping rope or fall over, you are out!
    - **Image alt text:** *Five children are playing a game, two of them holding a rope while the others watch.*
- After this, lower the skipping rope from 1 metre to 90 cm. Everyone still in keeps playing.
    - **Image alt text:** *Four children measure a distance of 90 cm with rulers, outdoors under a bright sky.*
- Finally, keep reducing the height of the skipping rope by 10 cm until only one person is left in.
    - **Image alt text:** *Three children play tug-of-war outdoors, with a gold star medal above them.*

#### c. Temporal Connectives
**Question:** Identify the temporal connective within each step.
- Example answers: First, Next, After, Finally

### SECTION 6: Analyse Results

#### Complete Results Table
- Fill in measurements and results for each student/group member.
- Table columns:
    - Name
    - Length of lower leg bone (in cm)
    - Order for length of lower leg bone (1st is the shortest, 5th the longest)
    - Best limbo height (in cm)
    - Order for height limboed (1st is the lowest, 5th the highest)

#### Questions to Investigate:
- Who had the shortest lower leg bones?
- Were they also the best at limbo?

---

### SECTION 7: Extension - Hypermobility

*Teaching Note: Discuss hypermobility (joints that move more than most people’s). About 20% of children are hypermobile; ask for class experiences. Invite thinking on what activities might give an advantage if you are hypermobile.*

**Information Box:**  
- Athletes that are very flexible, like Shrishti, are often double-jointed (hypermobility).

**Image alt text:** *A child performs a split on a yoga mat, smiling with arms and legs stretched out.*

**Table Activity:**  
- What sports or activities might you have an advantage in if you are hypermobile?  
  - Example answers:
      - Gymnastics: Being hypermobile in your hips might make it easier to do the splits.
      - Hide and seek: Being hypermobile might enable you to squeeze into places others can't.
      - Yoga: Being hypermobile might make it easier to get into difficult poses.
      - Other examples: Ballet (arabesque), Martial arts (higher kicks).

### SECTION 8: Extension - Height in Sport

*Teaching Note: Present info about NBA basketball players’ average height and an advert for The Skyscrapers team seeking tall players. Discuss and debate if the team should be allowed to advertise only for tall people.*

**Information:**  
> The average height of a male basketball player in the NBA is 198 cm—over 20 cm taller than the average male in Australia!

**Advertisement:**  
> The Skyscrapers basketball team is looking for some toweringly tall players to join their team. You must be over 190 cm tall to apply—the taller the better!

**Instruction:**  
- Be the judge. Do you think The Skyscrapers should be allowed to advertise for only tall people to join their team? Explain your thinking.  
  - Example answer: "No, I don't think it should be allowed. While being tall is definitely an advantage in basketball, it shouldn't be the only thing they consider. What if someone is shorter but an amazing shooter or really fast?"

- What reasons might someone give for having the opposite opinion to you?  
  - Example answer: "Yes, I think it should be allowed. If they're trying to win a championship, it makes sense to focus on players who have the biggest physical advantage."

### SECTION 9: Conclusion, Evaluation & Reflection

*Teaching Note: Encourage students to write a conclusion based on what they discovered, reflect on their predictions, suggest improvements, and new scientific questions about limbo they’d like to explore.*

#### Questions for Reflection:

1. Was your prediction correct? Explain why or why not.
    - Example: "Yes." (with explanation)
2. What have you found out by conducting this experiment?
    - Example: "I found out that people with shorter lower leg bones are more likely to be better at the limbo."
3. What would you change if you did the experiment again?
    - Example: "I would make sure everyone took their shoes off and wore the same clothes."
4. How happy were you with your experiment? (Choose from a set of face images representing different feelings.)
5. What other scientific questions would you like to investigate about limboing?
    - Example answers:
        - How does practice affect your limboing ability?
        - Are shorter people better at the limbo?
        - What surface is the best for limboing?

*Teaching Note: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of the student's ability to answer a scientific question through experimentation.*
