# Lesson Name
**Our Human Skeleton**

### Lesson URL
[https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5026-our-human-skeleton](https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5026-our-human-skeleton)

---

## Learning Intention

> Students are learning to:
- Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.

---

## Success Criteria

> By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Name different parts of their skeleton.
- Locate different parts of their skeleton on their own body.
- Describe how different parts of their skeleton offer protection or support.

---

## Teacher Reading

> Your skeleton is essential for providing structure and support to the human body. It also protects vital organs. For example, the skull shields the brain, and the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs.
>
> Young students may think that the skeleton is one large bone rather than lots of bones. Although not specifically mentioned in this lesson, an adult human has 206 bones that make up their skeleton. A baby, however, is born with approximately 300 bones that fuse together as they get older.

## Note

**Vocabulary Words**

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

---

## Introduction

Begin the lesson by showing the students the image of the two children (image description: *Two smiling girls colour on a white cast while sitting on a sofa, one holding a teddy bear.*)  
Ask:
- Why do you think one of the children is wearing a cast?

Introduce the focus question:
- "Why is our skeleton important?"

Encourage students to share their thoughts and any experiences they have had with broken bones or injuries, being mindful that this might be a sensitive subject for some students. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Section 1: Engage with "A Skeleton's Rant"  
### (Sections: Y5GTScCBhJs0, DE2TPJsf4mGF, baFcC3fTgMVk)

### Activity: Watch and Discuss the Video

- **Teacher Guidance:**  
  Students watch the video *A Skeleton's Rant* about a skeleton who goes on strike because he is fed up of not being appreciated.  
  It is recommended that students watch the video twice. After the first watch, check students' understanding of 'going on strike'.

- **Teaching Option:**  
  You could explain:  
  *Going on strike is when a group of people or an individual decides to stop doing their job for a while. They do this because they want to ask for something important, like better pay, safer workplaces, or more appreciation. It’s a way to say, "We need things to change."*

  In the video, the skeleton says he is going on strike because he doesn’t feel appreciated for the important job he does.  
  For example: *I told my family that I was going on strike because I was fed up with picking up their dirty washing off the floor.*

- **Student Instructions:**  
  - *Watch the video.*  
  - *Think, Pair, Share a time when you wanted to go on strike.*

---

### Subsection: Animation and Statement

- **Animation:**  
  *An animation of a person standing tall. His skeleton jumps out from his body, causing his body to collapse in a heap on the floor. The skeleton then picks up the collapsed body and jumps back in, so that it can stand tall once again.*

- **Teaching Notes:**  
  This animation illustrates, in an amusing way, what would happen if our skeletons went on strike. It aims to highlight to students the role our skeletons play in providing structure to our bodies.

- **Statement Box:**  
  *We need our skeletons! If our skeletons went on strike, we would just be a heap of flesh and skin.*

- **Image:**  
  *A surprised boy in a white t-shirt covers his mouth on a bright yellow background.*

## Section 5: Evaluate - Notes of Gratitude to Skeleton Parts  
### (Section: kMxqquzX6bxq, 4fuaFoZG6e5J)

### Activity: Writing Notes of Gratitude

- **Teaching Notes:**  
  This activity links back to the video in Activity 1 as students are asked to write some notes of gratitude to the parts of their skeleton, thanking them for the jobs they do.  
  Present the class with the example provided, guiding them through the checklist to ensure all elements are included. As you work through the checklist, you may wish to highlight the part of the example that addresses each part of the checklist.

- **Instructions:**  
  *Thank your skeleton! Your task is to write some notes of gratitude to the different parts of your skeleton. As a class, look at the example below. Use the checklist to make sure everything has been included.*

- **Example Table:**

  | **Skeleton part** | **Note of gratitude** |
  |-------------------|----------------------|
  | Clavicle          | I am grateful for my clavicles because they support my shoulders by holding them in place. |
  | Spine             | I am grateful for my spine because it supports me to stand up.                             |
  | Ribcage           | I am grateful for my ribcage because it protects my heart and lungs.                      |
  | Skull             | I am grateful for my skull because it protects my brain.                                  |
  | Pelvis            | I am grateful for my pelvis because it supports my body's weight.                         |

- **Checklist:**  
  *Each note of gratitude should include:*
    - [x] The name of the skeleton part.
    - [x] The conjunction 'because' to explain why you are grateful for that skeleton part.
    - [x] Whether the skeleton part protects or supports.

- **Student Instructions:**  
  *Now write your own notes of gratitude.*

- **Images:**
  - *An envelope with a letter inside that says "I am grateful for you!"*
  - *Hand ticking off items on a checklist with a pink pen against a pale purple background.*

- **Teaching Notes:**  
  This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.  
  To extend this activity and link further to English, you may wish to ask students to use a noun group in each of their sentences. Remind them that a noun group is a group of words that is built around a noun. They add meaning and make our writing more interesting.  
  Example: *I am grateful for my strong, dependable clavicles because they support my shoulders by holding them in place.*
