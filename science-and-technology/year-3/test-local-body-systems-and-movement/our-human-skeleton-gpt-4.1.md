## 1. Learning Intention

**Students are learning to:**
- Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.

---

## 2. Success Criteria

**By the end of this lesson, students will:**
- Name different parts of their skeleton.
- Locate different parts of their skeleton on their own body.
- Describe how different parts of their skeleton offer protection or support.

---

## 3. Teacher Reading

**Your skeleton is essential for providing structure and support to the human body. It also protects vital organs.**  
For example, the skull shields the brain, and the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs.

Young students may think that the skeleton is one large bone rather than lots of bones. Although not specifically mentioned in this lesson, an adult human has 206 bones that make up their skeleton. A baby, however, is born with approximately 300 bones that fuse together as they get older.

## 4. Note

**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## 5. Introduction

- Begin the lesson by showing the students the image of the two children (landscape image: "Two smiling girls colour on a white cast while sitting on a sofa, one holding a teddy bear.").
- Ask: 
   - **Why do you think one of the children is wearing a cast?**
- Introduce the focus question to students:  
  **'Why is our skeleton important?'**
- Encourage students to share their thoughts and any experiences they have had with broken bones or injuries, being mindful that this might be a sensitive subject for some students. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding and identify any misconceptions.

## 8. Section-by-Section Breakdown (with Subsections)

---

### Section V: Engage – What if your skeleton went on strike?

#### a. Subsection V  
**Watch the video.**  
- Watch the video: *A Skeleton's Rant* about a skeleton who goes on strike because he is fed up of not being appreciated.  
- It is recommended that students watch the video twice. After the first watch, check students' understanding of 'going on strike'.  
  - **Suggested explanation:**  
    > "Going on strike is when a group of people or an individual decides to stop doing their job for a while. They do this because they want to ask for something important, like better pay, safer workplaces, or more appreciation. It’s a way to say, 'We need things to change.'"
- In the video, the skeleton says he is going on strike because he doesn't feel appreciated for the important job he does.
- Teacher Example:  
  > "I told my family that I was going on strike because I was fed up with picking up their dirty washing off the floor."
- **Activity:** Think, Pair, Share a time when you wanted to go on strike.  

#### b. Subsection F  
**Teaching Note:**  
- Animation illustrates, in an amusing way, what would happen if our skeletons went on strike.
- Highlights the role skeletons play in providing structure to our bodies.
- **Image Alt Text:**  
  “An animation of a person standing tall. His skeleton jumps out from his body, causing his body to collapse in a heap on the floor. The skeleton then picks up the collapsed body and jumps back in, so that it can stand tall once again.”
- **Statement for students:**  
  > "We need our skeletons! If our skeletons went on strike, we would just be a heap of flesh and skin."
- **Image Alt Text:**  
  “A surprised boy in a white t-shirt covers his mouth on a bright yellow background.”

  - "Which skeleton parts did you not already know?  Use touch to find these parts on your own body." (student responses: text, draw, upload)
- **Rive Animation Alt Text:**  
  "An animation of an x-ray scan of a man, showing parts of his skeleton: skull, clavicle, ribcage, pelvis and spine."

### Section V: Explore – Be a scientist!

#### a. Subsection V  
**Teaching Note:**  
- Encourage students to be scientists by exploring their skeletons using touch.

**Adjectives Focus:**  
- Ask students to use adjectives to describe how their skeleton feels:
  - How does your spine feel under your fingers?
  - What words can you use to describe your ribcage and skull?
- Remind students that an adjective is a describing word (adds meaning to a noun).
- **Instructions:**
  > - "Bend forward and run your hand over your back. This is your **spine**."
  > - "Put your hands on your stomach. Move your hands up your body until you feel the bony bits. These are your **ribs**."
