# Lesson: Systems Working Together  
URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5059-systems-working-together  

## Focus Question  
**How do we move?**  

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of the lesson, students will:  
- Understand that our skeletal system includes bones and joints, whereas our muscular system includes muscles.  
- Make a scientific model of the arm to show how bones, joints and muscles work together.  
- Draw and label a diagram of their model using noun groups.  
- Use the provided scaffold to explain how their model works.  

## Teacher Reading  
A system is a collection of interconnected parts that work together to form a complex whole.  
The skeletal system provides the structural framework for the body and is composed of bones and joints.  
Muscles are attached to bones via tendons and move bones by contracting and relaxing, usually in pairs.  

## Note  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are Tier 2 and 3 words. They appear in **bold** throughout the lesson and should be taught in context.

## Activity Sequence  
The sections and subsections below follow **exactly** the order in the lesson’s section overview.

---

### 1. Section V – Listening for Instruments (Engage)  
#### Teaching Notes  
Students close their eyes and listen to the music (play twice if needed).  
After listening, students pair up to compare and discuss the instruments they heard.

#### Classroom Flow  
1. “Close your eyes. Listen to the music.” *(play video)*  
2. Question box: **“What instruments can you hear?”** (text, draw or upload)  
3. Instruction: “Compare what you heard with a classmate.”  

#### Sub-section k – Systems Example  
Statement:  
“Each instrument is part of a bigger **system**—the orchestra… A system is made up of smaller parts that work together to form something larger and more complicated.”  

Students view two systems:  
- Image (alt text): *“A round trampoline with a blue border and a black jump surface, set on metal legs.”*  
- Image (alt text): *“A white and orange children's bicycle with thick tyres and a black chain guard.”*  

Discussion prompts (exact wording):  
- “What is the name of each system?”  
- “What are the parts of each system?”  
- “What other systems can you think of?”  

##### Answers (examples)  
- Instruments heard: “Piano, violin and cello.”  
- System names: “Trampoline”, “Bike”.  
- Parts (example): “Trampoline – frame, springs, mat, safety pad.”

### 2. Section m – Finding Joints (Explore)  
#### Teaching Notes  
Students are introduced to the skeletal system and the new word **joint**.  
They make a fist to feel finger joints, then locate elbow, knee, hip and shoulder joints.

#### Classroom Flow  
1. Statement: “Our **skeletal system**… parts include bones and **joints**.”  
2. Instruction: “Find some joints.”  
3. In columns:  
   - Instruction:  
     - “Make a fist with your hand. The bumps on each finger are joints. These allow our fingers to move.”  
   - Image (alt text): *“A closed fist with arrows pointing to three joints, each labelled ‘Joint.’”*  
   - Instruction:  
     - “Move different parts of your body to find your:  
       • Elbow joint  
       • Knee joint  
       • Hip joint  
       • Shoulder joint”  
   - Image (alt text): *“Four children in playful poses against a light blue background.”*

### 3. Section o – Ball-and-Socket Joints (Explain)  
#### Teaching Notes  
Read the information about ball-and-socket joints and show the animation.  
Students recall the joints they explored and finish the sentence:  
“I think the _________ is a ball-and-socket joint because …”

#### Classroom Flow  
1. Statement: “We have different types of joints in our skeletal system.”  
2. Heading: **Ball-and-Socket Joints**  
3. Information box describes the joint, with GIF (alt text): *“A gif showing a ball and socket joint. The joint in the shoulder rotates around in different directions.”*  
4. Prompt: “Which one do you think is a ball-and-socket joint?”  
5. Discussion-response scaffold.  

##### Example Answer  
“I think the hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint because I can move my upper leg in all directions.”

---

#### Sub-section V – Hinge Joints  
##### Teaching Notes  
Read the information about hinge joints, show animation and ask:  
“Which joint do you think is a hinge joint? What makes you say that?”

##### Classroom Flow  
1. Heading: **Hinge Joints**  
2. Information box explanation, GIF (alt text): *“A gif showing a hinge joint… can move up and down.”*  
3. Instruction: “Think back to the joints you explored in Activity 2.”  
4. Discussion-response: “Which joint do you think is a hinge joint? What makes you say that?”

##### Example Answer  
“I think the knee joint is a hinge joint because my knee joint only moves forwards and backwards.”

---

### 4. Section wk – Muscles & Movement (Explore)  
#### Teaching Notes  
Explain that movement needs both the skeletal and muscular systems.  
Guide students through two movements and have them describe how their muscles felt.

#### Classroom Flow  
1. Statement: “To make our bodies move, our skeletal system has to work with our **muscular system**. There are about 600 muscles…”  
2. Instruction: “Feel your muscles.”  
3. Movement 1 (sit, straighten legs) – with image (alt text): *“A child sits on a stool with legs outstretched, smiling against a light blue background.”*  
4. Movement 2 (sit-up) – with image (alt text): *“A child … sitting with knees bent, and hands on their stomach.”*  
5. Discussion-response: “Describe how your muscles felt when you moved.”

##### Example Answer  
“My muscles felt like they were tightening when I moved.”

### 5. Section ws – Scientific Model Introduction (Explain)  
#### Teaching Notes  
Explain what a scientific model is and let students explore the interactive arm model.

#### Classroom Flow  
1. Statement: “A **scientific model** can help us understand how our muscular system and skeletal system work together.”  
2. Instruction: “Explore the scientific model and then use it to answer the questions on the next page.”  
3. Rive animation (interactive arm) with labels.  
4. Image (alt text): *“A young boy flexes his arm and grins, pointing to his bicep against a blue splatter background.”*

Discussion-responses (students complete one for each prompt):  
- “Length of the bicep”  
- “Length of the tricep”  
- “Lower arm bones”  

##### Example Answers  
- “When the bicep muscle tightens, the length of the bicep shortens.”  
- “When the bicep muscle tightens, the length of the tricep lengthens.”  
- “When the bicep muscle tightens, the lower arm bone moves.”

Assessment opportunity: observe students’ ability to model bones, muscles and joints.

#### Materials (per pair)  
- 2 rectangular pieces of card  
- 1 split pin  
- 1 elastic band, cut in half  
(Shared) staplers & hole punches  

#### Steps (sub-section Y) – **Temporal connectives**  
1. **First**, create an L-shape with your pieces of card. *(Image alt text: Two pieces of cardboard, arranged in an 'L' shape.)*  
2. **Next**, punch a hole… fasten with the split pin. *(Image alt text: Hole punched and split pin ready.)*  
3. **After this**, attach one piece of elastic to the inside – the bicep muscle. *(Image alt text: Stapling the elastic to cardboard.)*  
4. **Finally**, attach the other elastic to the outside – the tricep muscle. *(Image alt text: Completed model with both elastics.)*  

Instruction box (sub-section Y): “Steps”

### 8. Section z – Joint-Replacement Debate (Elaborate – Differentiation 3)  
#### Teaching Notes  
Explain joint replacement surgery using Tiger Woods as an example.  
Students decide who would agree or disagree with the statement and why.

#### Classroom Flow  
1. Statement box text about worn-out joints and Tiger Woods.  
2. Orange box statement: **“Athletes should not be allowed to compete if they have had a joint replacement.”**  
3. Table: rows for Tiger Woods’ opponents, fans, orthopaedic doctors; column “Agree or disagree?”  
4. Students justify their choices (text in table).

##### Example Answers  
- Opponents – *agree* (might think new joint gives advantage).  
- Fans – *disagree* (he still has to practise).  
- Orthopaedic doctors – *disagree* (replacement relieves pain, not skill).

## Conclusion / Assessment  
Revisit the focus question **“How do we move?”**  
Invite students to share their refined ideas, addressing any remaining misconceptions.
