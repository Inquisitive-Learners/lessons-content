# Lesson: Vertebrate or Invertebrate
[Lesson Link](https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5158-vertebrate-or-invertebrate)

---

## 1. Learning Intention

Students are learning to:

- Describe the differences between vertebrates and invertebrates.

---

## 2. Success Criteria

By the end of this lesson, students will:

- Understand that a vertebrate has a spine and an invertebrate does not.
- Sort animals into whether they are a vertebrate or invertebrate.
- Understand that some invertebrates have an external skeleton.
- Explain how vertebrates and invertebrates move.

---

## 3. Teacher Reading

All animals are classified as either vertebrates or invertebrates based on the presence or absence of a spine. Vertebrates have a backbone or spinal column, which is part of an internal skeleton that supports their body structure and allows for complex movements.

Invertebrates lack a spine and internal skeleton. They make up about 97% of all animal species. Some invertebrates have a hard external covering known as an exoskeleton. This external skeleton provides support and protection for their bodies.

The presence or absence of a spine influences how animals move. Vertebrates use their internal skeletons and muscles to facilitate movement, allowing for flexibility and strength. Invertebrates without a spine move differently. Worms use muscle contractions to slither along surfaces, and jellyfish, which lack both a spine and an external skeleton, drift and propel themselves softly through water currents. Invertebrates with exoskeletons, like crabs and spiders, move by using jointed legs attached to their exoskeletons to crawl, climb, or scuttle.

## 4. Note

**Vocabulary Words**

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## 5. Introduction

**Phenomena Image:**  
*A humpback whale breaching the ocean surface against a cloudy sky.*

Begin the lesson by showing students the image of the whale breaching in the water. Ask students the focus question:

> Do all animals have a skeleton?

Encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences with different animals, discussing which ones they think have a skeleton and why. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## 7. Sections and Activities (in correct order & with all subsections)

### **Section 1: Who Would Win at Hide and Seek? (Section: BvVD6A9Lp2zh)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Begin by asking students who they think would win a game of hide and seek and why. Encourage them to share their ideas and reasoning to stimulate their curiosity and set the context for the lesson.

**Discussion Prompt:**
- Who do you think would win a game of hide and seek? What makes you say that?  
  - Response types: text, draw, upload  
  - *Example answer:* "I think the clownfish would win because they are smaller."

**Images:**
- *Clownfish swimming among soft coral, featuring vibrant orange and white stripes.*  
  *Caption: A clownfish grows to about 8 cm in length.*
- *An octopus gliding gracefully through turquoise waters, surrounded by a rocky seabed.*  
  *Caption: An East Pacific octopus grows to about 40 cm in length.*

### **Section 1.1: Watch the Video (Subsection: 7cPbwsRTXLpR)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Show students the video of an octopus disappearing into the sand. Encourage them to observe the octopus's ability to hide and reflect on how this might change their opinion about who would win at hide and seek. Invite them to share their new thoughts and insights.

- "Watch the video."
- **Discussion Prompt:**  
  Has your opinion changed about who would win hide and seek?  
  - Response types: text, draw, upload  
  - *Example answer:* "Yes my opinion has changed because I didn't realise that an octopus could get into a hiding space that small!"

---

### **Section 2: An Octopus's Superpower (Section: nPSUz2zGddt9)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Explain that an octopus can squeeze into very small spaces because it has no spine, making its body extremely flexible. Present x-rays of various animals and encourage students to sort them into "spine" and "no spine".

- **Statement:**  
  "An octopus can squeeze into very small spaces, making it a master of hide and seek! This is because an octopus has no spine, so its body is very flexible."

- **Interactive Activity:**  
  "Click on each animal x-ray to enlarge it. Sort the animals into whether they have a spine or no spine."
  - (Animals include Octopus, Dog, Crab, Frog, Hamster, Fish, Stag Beetle, Squid.)

---

### **Section 3: Sorting Vertebrates and Invertebrates (Section: HHpRBXAidq3X)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Introduce the terms 'vertebrate' and 'invertebrate', explaining that animals with a spine and an internal skeleton are called vertebrates and those without a spine are called invertebrates. Students view the two groups of animals and answer true or false statements.

- **Statement:**  
  "Animals with a spine and an internal skeleton are called vertebrates. Animals with no spine are called invertebrates."
- **Instruction:**  
  "Look at how these animals have been grouped and then answer the true or false statements."
- **Images:**  
  - *A frog, a cockatoo and a cat.* (Spine group)  
  - *A worm, an ant and a jellyfish.* (No spine group)
- **Questions:**  
  - Frogs and cats are invertebrates. _(False; Correct answer: False)_
  - Ants and jellyfish are invertebrates. _(True; Correct answer: True)_
  - Earthworms are vertebrates because they have no spine. _(False; Correct answer: False)_
  - Birds are vertebrates because they have a spine. _(True; Correct answer: True)_

### **Section 4: Grouping Invertebrates by Features (Section: JogAs6ys2YXY)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Explain that invertebrates can be sorted into different groups based on specific features. Present two groups of invertebrates and instruct students to examine them carefully. Ask them to identify the feature that the invertebrates in group 1 have but those in group 2 do not. Answers are likely to vary, which is fine, provided students can justify their reasoning.

- **Statement:**  
  "Invertebrates can be sorted into different groups."
- **Instruction:**  
  "Look at the two groups of invertebrates."
- **Group 1 (Image):**  
  *An ant, a crab and a stag beetle.*
- **Group 2 (Image):**  
  *A jellyfish, a worm and an octopus.*
- **Discussion Prompt:**  
  "The invertebrates in group 1 have a feature that the invertebrates in group 2 do not. What do you think it is?"  
  - (Encourage students to justify their reasoning.)

### **Section 4.1: External Skeletons (Subsection: tTRwQuSfFovL)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Inform students that some invertebrates have a hard covering on the outside of their body called an external skeleton. Present the two groups—'Invertebrates with an external skeleton' and 'Invertebrates without an external skeleton'—and ask students to determine which group a particular invertebrate belongs to. Encourage them to explain their reasoning.

- **Statement:**  
  "Some invertebrates have a hard covering on the outside of their body. This is called an external skeleton. It helps protect the invertebrate from predators and supports them to move."
- **Groupings:**
  - Invertebrates with an external skeleton: *An ant, a crab and a stag beetle.*
  - Invertebrates without an external skeleton: *A jellyfish, a worm and an octopus.*
- **Discussion Questions:**  
  - "Which group would I go in?"  
    (Expected answer: Invertebrates with an external skeleton — for a spider image.)
  - "Where would you put me?"  
    (Expected answer: Invertebrates without an external skeleton — for a slug image.)

### **Section 5: How Do Animals Move? (Section: dowiuvgJAUFN)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Students watch the video of animals moving in water and on land. Ask students to read the descriptions provided and decide which animal's movement each one is describing.

- **Statements:**
  - "Whether an animal is a vertebrate or an invertebrate affects how they move."
- **Instruction:**  
  "Watch the video of the different animals moving in water and on the land."
- **Table Activity:**  
  "Match each animal to a description of how it moves."
    - I use my strong, flexible spine and tail fin to swim quickly through the water. – **Dolphin**
    - I crawl along the ocean floor using my jointed legs, which are connected to my external skeleton. – **Crab**
    - I slither along the ground using my muscles. – **Worm**
    - I float along in the water because I have no spine or external skeleton to support me. – **Jellyfish**
    - I use my jointed legs, which are connected to my external skeleton, to crawl or climb. – **Spider**
    - I use my internal skeleton and muscles to run quickly. – **Dog**

- **Image:**  
  *An earthworm.*

### **Section 6: Frayer Model on Vertebrates and Invertebrates (Section: MqobM3Kjgxo3)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
This activity asks students to complete a Frayer model for either a vertebrate or an invertebrate. If it is the first time the students have seen this type of graphic organiser, you may want to model completing it for a vertebrate and then ask students to complete their one for an invertebrate.

This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's understanding of the difference between vertebrates and invertebrates.

**Draw/Write Prompts:**  
- Definition: (e.g., "Vertebrates are animals that have a spine.")
- Non-examples: (e.g., Jellyfish, Crab, Spider, Worm)
- Examples: (e.g., Dog, Whale, Dolphin, Humans, Birds, Fish)
- How they move: (e.g., "Vertebrates use their internal skeleton and muscles to move on the land and in water.")
- Multiple Choice: "Use what you have learnt about vertebrates and invertebrates to complete a Frayer model."
  - My Frayer model is for a vertebrate. *(Correct)*
  - My Frayer model is for an invertebrate.

### **Section 7: Research on Invertebrates' Special Abilities (Section: 22AUhsE8q1ij)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Ask students to watch the *Disappearing Octopus* video again. Explain that you could describe the octopus's hide-and-seek skills as a special ability. Provide students with the research links and other trusted website or books, and ask them to find out about what special abilities other invertebrates have.

- "Watch the Disappearing Octopus again."
- **Research Prompt:**  
  "You could describe the octopus's hide-and-seek skills as a special ability. Use the websites provided or other trusted sites to research other invertebrates' special abilities."
- **Table Activity:**  
  Fill in the table:
  | Invertebrate                | Special ability                                     |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | Octopus                     | Octopus can regrow their limbs if they are lost or damaged. |
  | Immortal jellyfish          | This species of jellyfish can go back to being an infant if it becomes sick or injured. |
  | Tardigrade                  | Tardigrades can survive in the harshest of conditions including in extreme heat, extreme cold and in space. |

### **Section 8: 'Had a Backbone' Idiom – Bravery and Determination (Section: e1WrPjAHjwzj)**
#### Activity

**Teaching Notes:**
Explain that another word for a spine is 'backbone'. Introduce the idiom 'had a backbone', explaining that it describes someone who shows bravery and determination in difficult situations. Share examples like, 'Even though everyone disagreed with her, Maria had a backbone and stuck to her beliefs' and 'Liam showed he had a backbone when he told his friend to stop picking on another child.' Ask students to think of two personal examples when they have shown they 'had a backbone' and encourage them to share their experiences.

*Teacher prompting questions:*
  - Can you think of times when you demonstrated bravery or stood up for what you believe in?
  - When have you 'had a backbone' in a challenging situation?
  - You may like to extend students by introducing them to the word 'spineless'.

- "Another word for a spine is 'backbone'. The idiom 'had a backbone' is used to describe someone who shows bravery and determination in difficult situations."
- Read the examples:
  - Even though everyone disagreed with her, Maria had a backbone and stuck to her beliefs.
  - Liam showed he had a backbone when he told his friend to stop picking on another child.
- **Prompt:**  
  Think of two examples of when you have shown you had a backbone.
  - *Example answers:*  
    1. "I had a backbone when I told the truth even though I was scared I’d get in trouble."
    2. "I had a backbone when I stood up for my little brother after someone made fun of him."
