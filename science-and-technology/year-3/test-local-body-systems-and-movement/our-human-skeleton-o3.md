# Our Human Skeleton  
Lesson URL: <https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5026-our-human-skeleton>

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
• Name different parts of their skeleton.  
• Locate different parts of their skeleton on their own body.  
• Describe how different parts of their skeleton offer protection or support.  

## Focus Question  
Why is our skeleton important?  

## Teacher Reading  
Your skeleton is essential for providing structure and support to the human body. It also protects vital organs. For example, the skull shields the brain, and the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs.  
Young students may think that the skeleton is one large bone rather than lots of bones. Although not specifically mentioned in this lesson, an adult human has 206 bones that make up their skeleton. A baby, however, is born with approximately 300 bones that fuse together as they get older.  

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.  

## Introduction  
Begin the lesson by showing the students the image of the two children (alt text: *Two smiling girls colour on a white cast while sitting on a sofa, one holding a teddy bear.*). Ask:  
• Why do you think one of the children is wearing a cast?  
Introduce the focus question to students, “Why is our skeleton important?” Encourage the students to share their thoughts and any experiences they have had with broken bones or injuries, being mindful that this might be a sensitive subject for some students. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

# Lesson Sequence  

The sections and subsections below follow exactly the order shown in the Sections Overview.

---

## 1. Section V – Engage  
### Activity 1A – Watch the video “A Skeleton’s Rant”  
**Student instructions (exact wording)**  
Watch the video.  

**Teaching notes (S2JPCLD3i3GP)**  
Students watch the video *A Skeleton's Rant* about a skeleton who goes on strike because he is fed up of not being appreciated.  
• It is recommended that students watch the video twice.  
• After the first watch, check students' understanding of “going on strike”.  
Suggested explanation: *Going on strike is when a group of people or an individual decides to stop doing their job for a while. They do this because they want to ask for something important, like better pay, safer workplaces, or more appreciation. It’s a way to say, “We need things to change.”*  
• In the video, the skeleton says he is going on strike because he doesn't feel appreciated for the important job he does.  
• Think-Pair-Share a time when you wanted to go on strike.

### Activity 1B – Sub-section V – Animation “Skeleton on Strike”  
Image alt text: *An animation of a person standing tall. His skeleton jumps out from his body, causing his body to collapse in a heap on the floor. The skeleton then picks up the collapsed body and jumps back in, so that it can stand tall once again.*  

**Statement box (exact wording)**  
We need our skeletons! If our skeletons went on strike, we would just be a heap of flesh and skin.   

**Teaching note (m74wBbUbkUiP)**  
This animation illustrates, in an amusing way, what would happen if our skeletons went on strike. It aims to highlight to students the role our skeletons play in providing structure to our bodies.

### Activity 1C – Sub-section F – Discussion sentences  
**Plain text for students**  
Talk to a classmate about how you might complete each sentence.  

**Sentence frames (discussion-response components)**  
1. *If my skeleton went on strike, I would …*  
2. *I do not want my skeleton to go on strike because …*  

**Teaching note (1PGFur1KJnZB)**  
The purpose of this activity is twofold. Firstly, it encourages students to think about what would happen if their skeleton went on strike. Secondly, it allows students to use the conjunction *because* orally to explain why something is true.  

**Example answers**  
• If my skeleton went on strike I would not be able to stand up.  
• I do not want my skeleton to go on strike because I would not be able to walk.
