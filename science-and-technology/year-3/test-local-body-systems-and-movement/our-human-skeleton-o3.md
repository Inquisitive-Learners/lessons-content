# Our Human Skeleton  
Lesson page: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5026-our-human-skeleton  

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
1. Name different parts of their skeleton.  
2. Locate different parts of their skeleton on their own body.  
3. Describe how different parts of their skeleton offer protection or support.  

## Focus Question  
Why is our skeleton important?  

## Teacher Reading  
“Your skeleton is essential for providing structure and support to the human body. It also protects vital organs. For example, the skull shields the brain, and the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs.  
Young students may think that the skeleton is one large bone rather than lots of bones. Although not specifically mentioned in this lesson, an adult human has 206 bones that make up their skeleton. A baby, however, is born with approximately 300 bones that fuse together as they get older.”  

## Note  
Vocabulary Words  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.  

## Introduction  
Begin the lesson by showing the students the image of the two children (alt-text: “Two smiling girls colour on a white cast while sitting on a sofa, one holding a teddy bear.”). Ask:  
• Why do you think one of the children is wearing a cast?  

Introduce the focus question to students, *“Why is our skeleton important?”* Encourage the students to share their thoughts and any experiences they have had with broken bones or injuries, being mindful that this might be a sensitive subject for some students. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Activity 1 – A Skeleton’s Rant  *(Section V)*  
Watch the video “A Skeleton’s Rant”. (Teacher box: “Watch the video.”)  

**Teaching Notes** (use exactly as written)  
Students watch the video *A Skeleton's Rant* about a skeleton who goes on strike because he is fed up of not being appreciated.  
It is recommended that students watch the video twice. After the first watch, check students' understanding of 'going on strike'.  
You could explain it by saying the following:  
*Going on strike is when a group of people or an individual decides to stop doing their job for a while. They do this because they want to ask for something important, like better pay, safer workplaces, or more appreciation. It’s a way to say, 'We need things to change.'*  
*In the video, the skeleton says he is going on strike because he doesn't feel appreciated for the important job he does.*  
*I told my family that I was going on strike because I was fed up with picking up their dirty washing off the floor.*  
*Think, Pair, Share* a time when you wanted to go on strike.  

### Sub-section 1a – If Our Skeleton Went on Strike  *(DE2TPJsf4mGF)*  
Content: humorous animation (alt-text: “An animation of a person standing tall. His skeleton jumps out … stands tall once again.”)  
Statement box: “We need our skeletons! If our skeletons went on strike, we would just be a heap of flesh and skin.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
This animation illustrates, in an amusing way, what would happen if our skeletons went on strike. It aims to highlight to students the role our skeletons play in providing structure to our bodies.  

### Sub-section 1b – Sentence Frames  *(baFcC3fTgMVk)*  
Students complete two discussion stems:  
• “If my skeleton went on strike, I would …”  
• “I do not want my skeleton to go on strike because …”  
Plain text prompt: “Talk to a classmate about how you might complete each sentence.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
The purpose of this activity is twofold. Firstly, it encourages students to think about what would happen if their skeleton went on strike. Secondly, it allows students to use the conjunction 'because' orally to explain why something is true.  

**Answers (examples)**  
If my skeleton went on strike I would not be able to stand up.  
I do not want my skeleton to go on strike because I would not be able to walk.

## Activity 2 – Be a Scientist! Explore by Touch  *(Section o)*  
Purple statement box:  
“Scientists have studied the parts of the human skeleton for many years. Early scientists studied it by using touch.”  
Instruction box: “Be a scientist! Follow the instructions on the next page to study your skeleton using touch.”  
Images: historical scientists Avicenna and Vesalius (alt-texts included).

**Teaching Notes**  
Read the purple box and the speech bubble to students. Explain that they are going to be a scientist by exploring their own skeletons by touch.  

### Sub-section 2a – Touch Instructions  *(QRpLxxYvWC3o)*  
Three instruction boxes (spine, skull, ribs) each paired with a photograph (alt-text examples: “A boy in a grey t-shirt leans down, placing his hand on his spine.”).  

**Teaching Notes**  
Encourage students to be scientists by exploring their own skeletons using touch, just like early scientists did. Guide them to locate different parts of their skeleton on their own body.  
Have students use adjectives to describe how each skeleton part feels: Ask:  
• How does your spine feel under your fingers?  
• What words can you use to describe your ribcage and skull?  
You may need to remind students that an adjective is a describing word. They are used to modify nouns, which means they add more meaning to a noun.  

**Student discussion prompt**  
“What adjectives can you use to describe what you are feeling?”  

**Example response**  
“My spine feels bumpy, hard and flexible. My skull feels smooth, hard and solid. My ribcage feels hard, bony and fragile.”

## Activity 3 – Interactive X-ray Scan  *(Section s)*  
Students click ‘Scan’ on the animation (alt-text: “An animation of an x-ray scan of a man, showing parts of his skeleton: skull, clavicle, ribcage, pelvis and spine.”) to reveal and label five parts.  

Instruction box:  
“Click ‘Scan’ to x-ray the person.  
Click the pulsing points to see the names of some different parts.”  

Statement box: “Today, we can use x-rays to study skeletons.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students use the interactive x-ray by clicking 'Scan' to study the human skeleton. The skeleton has five parts labelled: the spine, ribcage, skull, clavicle and pelvis. The first three parts listed, students will be familiar with from the previous activity. The pelvis and clavicle will likely be unfamiliar parts.  
Have students use touch to find these unfamiliar parts of their skeleton on their own bodies.  

### Sub-section 3a – Skeleton Quiz  *(PSXCsFWzAW06)*  
Banner image “Quiz” (alt-text: “Quiz text overlay on an x-ray background with a blue hue.”)  
Plain text: “Use the x-ray on the previous page to help you answer the questions.”  

Three multiple-choice questions (answers in **bold**):  

1. Select the word that completes the sentence “The _________ connects the upper body to the legs.”  
   • Skull • Spine • **Pelvis**  

2. Which skeleton part do you think is sometimes called “backbone”? Explain your thinking.  
   • **Spine** • Clavicle • Ribs  
   Example explanation: “The spine is sometimes called the ‘backbone’ due to its location being in the back.”  

3. Which skeleton part looks like a cage?  
   • Pelvis • **Ribs** • Skull  

4. Which skeleton part is sometimes called the “collarbone”? Explain your thinking.  
   • Skull • **Clavicle** • Pelvis  
   Example explanation: “The clavicle is often called a ‘collarbone’ due to its location being near the collar region.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students use x-ray image from the previous activity to answer questions about the skeleton.

## Activity 4 – Read the eBook: Jobs of Skeleton Parts  *(Section u)*  
Statement box: “Different parts of our skeleton have different jobs.”  
Instruction box: “Read the eBook to find out more about the job of each part of your skeleton.”  
Embedded eBook.  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students read the eBook to find out what different jobs the parts of their skeleton have. The eBook focuses on the five parts of the skeleton that have been covered thus far in the lesson.  

### Sub-section 4a – Sentence Frames after Reading  *(NKPFnV4Qf6Ko)*  
Prompt: “Complete the sentences with a classmate.”  
Sentence frames inside speech bubbles:  
• “I now know that …”  
• “I was surprised to find out _______ because …”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students discuss their findings from the eBook with a classmate using the sentence frames. The second sentence frame gives students a further opportunity to use the conjunction 'because' orally to explain why something is true.  

**Example answers**  
I now know that the skull and the ribcage protect our heart and lungs.  
I was surprised to find out that the clavicle was the most common bone to break because it seemed really strong to me.

## Activity 5 – Thank Your Skeleton!  *(Section w – Checkpoint)*  
Blue instruction box: “Thank your skeleton!”  
Instruction box: “Your task is to write some notes of gratitude to the different parts of your skeleton. As a class, look at the example below. Use the checklist to make sure everything has been included.”  
Example gratitude table shown.  

**Teaching Notes**  
This activity links back to the video in Activity 1 as students are asked to write some notes of gratitude to the parts of their skeleton, thanking them for the jobs they do.  
Present the class with the example provided, guiding them through the checklist to ensure all elements are included. As you work through the checklist, you may wish to highlight the part of the example that addresses each part of the checklist.  

### Checklist (multi-select – all three items should be ticked)  
☐ The name of the skeleton part.  
☐ The conjunction ‘because’ to explain why you are grateful for that skeleton part.  
☐ Whether the skeleton part protects or supports.  

### Sub-section 5a – Write Your Own Gratitude Notes  *(4fuaFoZG6e5J)*  
Students complete their own table.  
Image: “Hand ticking off items on a checklist …”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students write their own notes of gratitude to various parts of their skeleton, using the checklist to help them.  
To extend this activity and link further to English, you may wish to ask students to use a noun group in each of their sentences. Remind them that a noun group is a group of words that is built around a noun. They add meaning and make our writing more interesting.  
For example, “I am grateful for my strong, dependable clavicles because they support my shoulders by holding them in place.”  

**Example answers** (from class model)  
Skeleton part: Spine – I am grateful for my spine because it supports me to stand up.  
Skeleton part: Ribcage – I am grateful for my ribcage because it protects my heart and lungs.  
Skeleton part: Skull – I am grateful for my skull because it protects my brain.  
Skeleton part: Pelvis – I am grateful for my pelvis because it supports my body’s weight.

## Activity 6 – Think, Feel, Care Routine  *(Section y – Differentiation 2)*  
Statement box: “Sometimes, parts of your skeleton go on strike! When you break a bone, it stops doing its job properly.”  
Scenario text about Jessie breaking her femur (alt-text of photo: “Two girls sitting on a sofa, colouring a bandaged leg, one holding a teddy bear.”).  

Students complete the *Think, Feel, Care* table for both Jessie and her femur.

**Teaching Notes**  
Present the scenario where Jessie has broken her femur, explaining that it is the longest, strongest and heaviest bone that supports body weight when standing, walking, or running. Students then complete the *Think, Feel, Care* thinking routine from the perspective of both Jessie and her femur.  
To support students' thinking, ask:  
• What might Jessie be thinking or feeling after breaking her femur?  
• If Jessie's femur could talk, what would it express about being broken?  
• How does the femur's injury impact Jessie's daily life?  

**Example answers**  
Jessie thinking – “Why did this happen to me?”  
Jessie feeling – “Sad and frustrated because I can't run or play with my friends.”  
Jessie care – “I care about still being included in activities while my femur gets better.”  
Femur thinking – “I'm the strongest bone in the body but now I am broken!”  
Femur feeling – “Worried because I can't do my job of supporting Jessie's body anymore.”  
Femur care – “I care about healing quickly so that I can support Jessie again.”

## Activity 7 – Analogies: House, Tree, Chair  *(Section z – Differentiation 3)*  
Instruction box: “Explain how our skeleton is like a:”  

Columns with response boxes and simple line images (alt-texts: house, tree, chair).  

**Teaching Notes**  
Challenge students to explain how the human skeleton is like a house, a tree and a chair. Encourage them to use critical and creative thinking to draw analogies focusing on structure, support and function.  

**Example answers**  
House – “Our skeleton is like a house because it protects things inside it. For example, a skeleton protects organs and a house protects the people inside from the weather.”  
Tree – “Our skeleton is like a tree because they both grow over time.”  
Chair – “Our skeleton is like a chair because it supports our body and helps us stay upright, just like a chair supports someone when they sit on it.”

## Conclusion & Assessment  
Revisit the focus question: **Why is our skeleton important?**  
Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still exist.  

*(Teacher checkpoint: “This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.”)*
