# Lesson: Systems Working Together  
[Lesson page link](https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/5059-systems-working-together)

---

## 1. Learning Intention

> **Students are learning to:**
> - Model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement.

---

## 2. Success Criteria

> **By the end of the lesson, students will:**
> - Understand that our skeletal system includes bones and joints, whereas our muscular system includes muscles.
> - Make a scientific model of the arm to model how bones, joints and muscles work together.
> - Draw a diagram of their model and use noun groups to label it.
> - Use the provided scaffold to explain how their model works.

---

## 3. Teacher Reading

> **A system** is a collection of interconnected parts that work together to form a complex whole. In the context of the human body, systems like the skeletal, muscular and nervous systems collaborate to enable movement and maintain overall function.  
> 
> **The Skeletal System**:  
> The skeletal system provides the structural framework for the body. It is composed of bones and joints that support and protect internal organs, facilitate movement and produce blood cells. Bones are connected at joints, which allow for various types of movement depending on their structure.  
>
> **The Muscular System:**  
> Muscles are attached to bones via tendons and work by contracting and relaxing. They often work in pairs to move bones at the joints.

## 4. Note

> **Vocabulary Words**  
> The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

2. **Explanation:**  
   - _"A ball-and-socket joint is where the end of one bone (the ball part) fits into a hollow space in another bone (the socket part). These joints allow movement in all directions, giving the most flexibility within the human body. Our shoulder joint is an example of a ball-and-socket joint."_
3. **GIF:**  
   - _A gif showing a ball and socket joint. The joint in the shoulder rotates around in different directions._

4. **Discussion:**  
   - _"I think the _________ is a ball-and-socket joint because ..."_  
     **Sample Answers:**  
     - "I think the hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint because I can move my upper leg in all directions."
5. **Instruction:**  
    - _"Think back to the joints you explored in Activity 2. Which one do you think is a ball-and-socket joint?"_

**Hinge Joints (Section `HF6chUzhkXFn`)**

1. **Explanation:**
