---

## Learning Intention

- Model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement.

## Success Criteria

By the end of the lesson, students will:
- Understand that our skeletal system includes bones and joints, whereas our muscular system includes muscles.
- Make a scientific model of the arm to model how bones, joints and muscles work together.
- Draw a diagram of their model and use noun groups to label it.
- Use the provided scaffold to explain how their model works.

## Teacher Reading

A system is a collection of interconnected parts that work together to form a complex whole. In the context of the human body, systems like the skeletal, muscular and nervous systems collaborate to enable movement and maintain overall function.

**The Skeletal System:**  
The skeletal system provides the structural framework for the body. It is composed of bones and joints that support and protect internal organs, facilitate movement and produce blood cells. Bones are connected at joints, which allow for various types of movement depending on their structure.

**The Muscular System:**  
Muscles are attached to bones via tendons and work by contracting and relaxing. They often work in pairs to move bones at the joints.

## Note

**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Lesson Flow & Activities

### 1. Introduction

**Display the image of the child being pushed by an adult. Ask:**  
"How do we move?"  
Encourage students to share their ideas about how our bodies enable movement. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

### 2. Activity: Listening to Music—Engage

**Teaching Note:**  
Students close their eyes and listen to the music. You may wish to play the music twice. The first time students should just listen for enjoyment and the second time they should listen to identify the different instruments they can hear. After listening, have students pair up to compare and discuss the instruments they heard.

#### Instructions/Questions:
- "Close your eyes. Listen to the music."
- Afterward:  
  - "What instruments can you hear?" (respond by text, drawing, or upload)
  - "Compare what you heard with a classmate."

#### Image:
- **Alt Text:** A young child in headphones smiles against a yellow background with musical instruments around her: a violin, a piano, symbols and a trumpet.

#### Answers:
- Example: "Piano, violin and cello."

---

#### 2A. Subsection: Understanding Systems

**Statement:**  
"Each instrument is part of a bigger system—the orchestra. A system is made up of smaller parts that work together to form something larger and more complicated."

**Look at these systems.**
- Image: Trampoline  
  - **Alt Text:** A round trampoline with a blue border and a black jump surface, set on metal legs.
- Image: Bicycle  
  - **Alt Text:** A white and orange children's bicycle with thick tyres and a black chain guard.

**Questions (with discussion or written responses):**
- What is the name of each system?  
  - Example answers: "Trampoline", "Bike"
- What are the parts of each system?  
  - Example answers: "Trampoline: frame, springs, mat and safety pad"  
    "Bike: frame, wheels, tires, handlebars, breaks, pedals, chain and saddle"
- What other systems can you think of?  
  - Example answers: "A car", "The Solar System", "A computer system"

### 3. Activity: Finding and Exploring Joints

**Teaching Note:**  
The purpose of this activity is to introduce students to the skeletal system and how it includes bones and joints.

- **Our skeletal system** is in our body. The parts of our skeletal system include our bones and our **joints**.
- A joint is where two or more bones connect.
- Students now find some joints on their own bodies. Guide them to make a fist with their hand and feel the bumps on each finger, highlighting how these joints enable movement. Students then move other parts of their bodies to identify the elbow, knee, hip and shoulder joints.

#### Instructions:
- "Find some joints."
- "Make a fist with your hand. The bumps on each finger are joints. These allow our fingers to move."
- "Move different parts of your body to find your:"
    - Elbow joint
    - Knee joint
    - Hip joint
    - Shoulder joint

#### Image:
- **Alt Text:** A closed fist with arrows pointing to three joints, each labelled "Joint."
- **Alt Text:** Four children in playful poses against a light blue background.

### 4. Activity: Types of Joints—Explain

#### Part 1: Ball-and-Socket Joints

- **Statement:** "We have different types of joints in our skeletal system."
- **Ball-and-Socket Joints:** "A ball-and-socket joint is where the end of one bone (the ball part) fits into a hollow space in another bone (the socket part). These joints allow movement in all directions, giving the most flexibility within the human body. Our shoulder joint is an example of a ball-and-socket joint."

- **Image/GIF:**  
  - **Alt Text:** A gif showing a ball and socket joint. The joint in the shoulder rotates around in different directions.

- **Instruction:**  
  "Think back to the joints you explored in Activity 2. Which one do you think is a ball-and-socket joint?"

- **Discussion/Completion:**  
  "I think the _________ is a ball-and-socket joint because ..."
    - Example answers:
      - "I think the hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint because I can move my upper leg in all directions."
      - "I think the shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint because it can move all directions."

#### Part 2: Hinge Joints

- **Heading:** Hinge Joints
- **Description:** "Hinge joints work like the hinges on a door. They allow movement in one direction such as bending and straightening. The elbow joint is an example of a hinge joint."
- **Instructions:** "Think back to the joints you explored in Activity 2. Which joint do you think is a hinge joint? What makes you say that?"
    - Example answer: "I think the knee joint is a hinge joint because my knee joint only moves forwards and backwards."

- **Image/GIF:**  
  - **Alt Text:** A gif showing a hinge joint, which looks like a cylinder turning back and forth. It can't rotate around, but can move up and down.

### 5. Activity: Feeling Muscles—Explore

**Teaching Note:**  
Explain that movement requires the skeletal system to work with the muscular system, which contains about 600 muscles.

#### Instructions:
- "Sit on a chair. Put your hands on your thighs. Straighten your legs so your feet are out in front of you."
- "Lie on the floor with your knees bent. Put your hand on your stomach. Sit up."
- For students with mobility issues:
  - "Straighten one arm"
  - "Put your other hand on your upper arm"
  - "Bend your elbow joint"

- After completing each activity, ask:
  - "Describe how your muscles felt when you moved."
      - Example answer: "My muscles felt like they were tightening when I moved."

#### Images:
- **Alt Text:** A child sits on a stool with legs outstretched, smiling against a light blue background.
- **Alt Text:** A child in a black t-shirt and shorts sitting with knees bent, and hands on their stomach.

### 6. Activity: Scientific Models—Explain

**Teaching Note:**  
Students are introduced to how a scientific model can help us understand how our muscular system and skeletal systems work together.

- **Statement:** "A scientific model can help us understand how our muscular system and skeletal system work together."
- **Definition:**  
  "A scientific model is a pretend version of something real that helps scientists understand or explain how something works. A scientific model might be a diagram, a 3D model, or an animation."

#### Activity:
- Students explore the scientific model of an arm moving, clicking "Move arm."
- **Animated model** with labels: Bicep muscle, Elbow joint, Lower arm bones, Tricep muscle

#### Image:
- **Alt Text:** A young boy flexes his arm and grins, pointing to his bicep against a blue splatter background.

#### 6A. Subsection: Using the Model to Explain Movement

**Teaching Note:**  
Students use the scientific model to explain what happens when the bicep tightens.  
Sentence scaffold:  
- "When the bicep muscle tightens, the ..."

**Questions:**
- When the bicep muscle tightens, what happens to the:
  - Length of the bicep?
      - Example answer: "When the bicep muscle tightens, the length of the bicep shortens."
  - Length of the tricep?
      - Example answer: "When the bicep muscle tightens, the length of the tricep lengthens."
  - Lower arm bones?
      - Example answer: "When the bicep muscle tightens, the lower arm bone moves."

#### Image
- **Alt Text:** A young boy in glasses with spiky hair, pondering with a finger on his mouth against a blue splatter background.

### 7. Activity: Making a Model of the Arm—Evaluate

**Teaching Note:**  
Students create their own scientific model demonstrating how muscles, bones and joints work together to create movement. Organise students into pairs and provide them materials: card (cereal box thickness), split pin, elastic band cut in half, staplers, and hole punches.

#### Materials:
- 2 rectangular pieces of card (e.g., from a cereal box)
- 1 split pin
- 1 elastic band (cut in half)
- Staplers
- Hole punches

#### Image:
- **Alt Text:** Different materials: two pieces of cardboard, a stapler, a hole puncher, a blue rubber band that has been cut in half and a split pin.

#### 7A. Subsection: Construction Steps

- **Step 1:** "First, create an L-shape with your pieces of card. These represent your arm bones."
    - **Image:** Two pieces of cardboard, arranged in an 'L' shape.

- **Step 2:** "Next, punch a hole in each of the arm bones. Fasten the arm bones together using the split pin. This represents the elbow joint."
    - **Image:** The two pieces of cardboard now have a hole where they overlap, with a split pin.

- **Step 3:** "After this, attach one piece of the elastic band to the inside of arm bones. This represents the bicep muscle."
    - **Image:** The two pieces of cardboard are now connected by a split pin; a stapler is needed to staple one half of the rubber band.

- **Step 4:** "Finally, attach the other piece of elastic band to the outside of the arm bones. This represents the tricep muscle."
    - **Image:** The two pieces of cardboard are now connected by: a split pin, a cut rubber band for the bicep, and another for the tricep. Behind is a faded image of someone flexing their arm.

**Instruction Box:**  
- "Now make your model."

#### 7B. Subsection: Steps Language Focus

- **Statement:** "Some words link ideas together to help us understand when something should be done. These are called temporal connectives."
- **Question:** "Identify the temporal connectives in the steps."
  - Example answers: "First", "Next", "After this", "Finally"

---

#### 7C. Subsection: Drawing and Labelling the Model

- Students make their model and then draw a detailed diagram of it.
- They should label their model using the list of noun groups provided:
  - "Use these noun groups to label your diagram."
    - The elbow joint (correct),
    - The upper arm bone,
    - The lower arm bones,
    - The bicep muscle,
    - The tricep muscle

- **Statement:** "A noun group is a group of words that give more meaning to a noun."

### 9. Activity: Prosthetics

- **Information:**  
  "Occasionally, a part of our skeletal system is missing. Prosthetic limbs can replace a missing leg, arm or hand. They are made out of strong materials like plastic and metal, and work like the missing limb."
- **Image:** A young girl in a black tutu poses, showcasing her prosthetic leg.
- **Image:** A young boy receives basketball shooting guidance from an older teenager on a court.
- **Image:** Two children in a classroom, one with a prosthetic arm, using laptops and headphones.
- **Speech Bubbles:**
    - "The muscles in my upper arm control my prosthetic arm."
    - "My prosthetic leg allows me to run, jump and even play basketball."
    - "Every year, I have to go to the hospital to have a new prosthetic leg fitted because I am still growing."

---

#### 9A. Subsection: Reflection—Connect, Extend, Challenge

**Questions:**
- "How did the information connect with what you already knew?"
    - Example: "I have seen athletes wear prosthetics in the Paralympics."
    - Image: A person holds a black prosthetic hand, about to connect it to the prosthetic arm.
- "How did the information extend your thinking?"
    - Example: "I didn't know that your prosthetic needed to be changed as you grow."
    - Image: A person extends out their prosthetic arm, about to touch a button on the hand.
- "What questions do you still have?"
    - Example: "How do doctors decide on the right type of prosthetic for you?"
    - Image: A person holding a coffee cup with a prosthetic arm, wearing a blue shirt.

### 10. Activity: Joint Replacements—Elaborate

- **Information:**  
  Sometimes, when they are used a lot, joints stop working properly. This makes it painful to move around. Orthopaedic doctors can replace the worn-out joint with a new, artificial one. Tiger Woods is an example of a successful athlete who had a knee joint replacement.

**Statement to Discuss:**  
"Athletes should not be allowed to compete if they have had a joint replacement."

**Task:**  
Using the table provided, students determine if Tiger Woods' opponents, his fans, and orthopaedic doctors would agree or disagree with that statement, and explain why.

**Sample Answers:**
- Tiger Woods' opponents:
    - "They would agree because they might think that a new knee joint would enable Tiger Woods to play better than he had before, without any pain."
- Tiger Woods' fans:
    - "They would disagree because they might argue that despite having a new knee joint, Tiger Woods would still have to practise as much as everyone else."
- Orthopaedic doctors:
    - "They would disagree because they might argue that getting a new knee joint just relieves pain, it does not make your golfing skills any better."
