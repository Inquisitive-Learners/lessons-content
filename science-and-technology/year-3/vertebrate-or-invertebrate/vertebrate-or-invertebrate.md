Topic Name: TEST local Depending on Energy.
Topic overview: In Stage 2, students cover the focus area Physical and living systems depend on energy. The focus area has been broken down into nine Inquisitive units.  In Year 3, students cover the following units:  Earth's Systems and Environments (Coming in late 2025)  States and Properties of Matter (Coming in late 2025)  Body Systems and Movement  Transferring Heat Energy (Coming in late 2025)  Our Solar System (Coming in late 2025)  In Year 4, students cover the following units:  Energy Flow and Relationships in Ecosystems  (Coming in late 2025)  Heat Energy Changes Matter (Coming in late 2025)  Forces Change Earth's Surface Gravity in Our Solar System  (Coming in late 2025) .
--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Body Systems and Movement 
Unit overview: In this unit, students learn how body systems work together to enable movement. Through hands-on activities and digital simulations, they will learn the key parts of our skeleton that provide us with support and protection and model how our skeletal and muscular systems work together to enable us to move. By investigating the scientific question, Are people with shorter bones in their lower legs better at the limbo?  students deepen their understanding of the topic, while also learning how to plan, conduct and evaluate a fair test. The unit culminates with students exploring the difference between vertebrates and invertebrates and how this difference affects their movement.  Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete. Teaching notes for each lesson include: A lesson overview Background teacher reading notes Resources and materials if needed Detailed teaching and learning sequences for each activity with additional questioning and learning opportunities, suggestions for differentiating instruction, and sample answers References to the 5E elements developed in each activity Practical tips for conducting hands-on activities Unit and lesson teaching notes can be downloaded as an editable document..

Lesson name: Vertebrate or Invertebrate?
Lesson duration: 30 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: Do all animals have a skeleton? 

Focus question image: A humpback whale breaching the ocean surface against a cloudy sky.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students learn the difference between vertebrates and invertebrates and how this difference affects how different animals move. Students demonstrate their learning by completing either a Frayer model for vertebrates or invertebrates.  This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary and noun groups to enhance the specificity of texts. This lesson also supports the following English outcomes:  EN2-VOCAB-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
- Begin the lesson by showing students the image of the whale breaching in the
water. Ask students the focus question,

'Do all animals have a skeleton?' Encourage them to share their thoughts and
experiences with different animals, discussing which ones they think have a
skeleton and why. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
- Students are learning to:

 * Describe the differences between vertebrates and invertebrates.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- By the end of this lesson, students will:

 * Understand that a vertebrate has a spine and an invertebrate does not.

 * Sort animals into whether they are a vertebrate or invertebrate.

 * Understand that some invertebrates have an external skeleton.

 * Explain how vertebrates and invertebrates move.

TEACHER KNOWLEDGE:
- All animals are classified as either vertebrates or invertebrates based on the
presence or absence of a spine. Vertebrates have a backbone or spinal column,
which is part of an internal skeleton that supports their body structure and
allows for complex movements.

Invertebrates lack a spine and internal skeleton. They make up about 97% of all
animal species. Some invertebrates have a hard external covering known as an
exoskeleton. This external skeleton provides support and protection for their
bodies.

The presence or absence of a spine influences how animals move. Vertebrates use
their internal skeletons and muscles to facilitate movement, allowing for
flexibility and strength. Invertebrates without a spine move differently. Worms
use muscle contractions to slither along surfaces, and jellyfish, which lack
both a spine and an external skeleton, drift and propel themselves softly
through water currents. Invertebrates with exoskeletons, like crabs and spiders,
move by using jointed legs attached to their exoskeletons to crawl, climb, or
scuttle.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
- As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Do all animals have a skeleton?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
- This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of the difference between vertebrates and invertebrates.

Description: Explain that another word for a spine is 'backbone'. Introduce the idiom 'had a
backbone', explaining that it describes someone who shows bravery and
determination in difficult situations. Share examples like, 'Even though
everyone disagreed with her, Maria had a backbone and stuck to her beliefs' and
'Liam showed he had a backbone when he told his friend to stop picking on
another child.' Ask students to think of two personal examples when they have
shown they 'had a backbone' and encourage them to share their experiences.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * Can you think of times when you demonstrated bravery or stood up for what you
   believe in?

 * When have you 'had a backbone' in a challenging situation?

You may like to extend students further by introducing them to the word
'spineless', which when used figuratively, describes someone who is weak,
cowardly, or afraid to stand up for themselves.

ACTIVITY 4:
Activity ID: gH1cyBjPTsQH
Section ID: JogAs6ys2YXY
Description: Explain that invertebrates can be sorted into different groups based on specific
features. Present two groups of invertebrates and instruct students to examine
them carefully. Ask them to identify the feature that the invertebrates in group
1 have but those in group 2 do not. Answers are likely to vary, which is fine,
provided students can justify their reasoning.

Teacher prompting questions:

 * What do you think is the difference between the invertebrates in group 1 and
   group 2?

 * What feature distinguishes these two groups of invertebrates?
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Invertebrates can be sorted into different groups. 
[Discussion] The invertebrates in group 1 have a feature that the invertebrates in group 2 do
not. 

What do you think it is?
[Plain Text] Look at the two groups of invertebrates.
[Plain Text] Group 1
[Image] An ant, a crab and a stag beetle.
[Plain Text] Group 2
[Image] A jellyfish, a worm and an octopus.

PART 2:
[Statement Box] Some invertebrates have a hard covering on the outside of their body. This is
called an external skeleton. It helps protect the invertebrate from predators
and supports them to move. 
[Discussion] Which group would I go in?
[Discussion] Where would you put me?

ACTIVITY 2:
Activity ID: EJx7Pxh29HJp
Section ID: nPSUz2zGddt9
Description: Explain that an octopus can squeeze into very small spaces because it has no
spine, making its body extremely flexible. Present x-rays of various animals:
octopus, stag beetle, squid, crab, dog, frog, fish and hamster. Encourage
students to look at each x-ray carefully and decide whether each animal has or
does not have a spine.
[Statement Box] An octopus can squeeze into very small spaces, making it a master of hide and
seek!

This is because an octopus has no spine, so its body is very flexible.
