**Year:** Year 3

**Lesson ID:** 5059

**Lesson name:** Systems Working Together

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How do we move? 

**Focus question image:**
A man pushes a girl in a cardboard box, both smiling joyfully in a bright room.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students are introduced to the concept of a system—something that is made up of smaller parts to form something larger and more complex. They learn that our skeletal system is an example of this and includes our joints and bones. Students explore finding different joints in their bodies and decide whether they think each joint is a hinge joint or a ball-and-socket joint. The latter half of the lesson introduces students to the muscular system and how the skeletal and muscular systems work together to enable movement. They explore a digital model showing how this happens and then create their own model using hands-on materials.  This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content points:  Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary and noun groups to enhance the specificity of texts. Use temporal and causal connectives and labelled diagrams when explaining the process of conducting a fair test. Use notes, diagrams, flow charts and annotations to support understanding and explain processes. The lesson supports the following English outcomes:  EN2-OLC-01, EN2-VOCAB-01

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Display the image of the child being pushed by an adult. Ask students, 'How do
we move?' Encourage them to share their ideas about how our bodies enable
movement. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of the lesson, students will:
- Understand that our skeletal system includes bones and joints, whereas our
- muscular system includes muscles.
- Make a scientific model of the arm to model how bones, joints and muscles
- work together.
- Draw a diagram of their model and use noun groups to label it.
- Use the provided scaffold to explain how their model works.

**TEACHER READING:**
A system is a collection of interconnected parts that work together to form a
complex whole. In the context of the human body, systems like the skeletal,
muscular and nervous systems collaborate to enable movement and maintain overall
function.

The Skeletal System

The skeletal system provides the structural framework for the body. It is
composed of bones and joints that support and protect internal organs,
facilitate movement and produce blood cells. Bones are connected at joints,
which allow for various types of movement depending on their structure.

The Muscular System

Muscles are attached to bones via tendons and work by contracting and relaxing.
They often work in pairs to move bones at the joints.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How do we move?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Cardboard, Elastic band, Split pin, Hole punch, Stapler

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST2-SCI-01 (uses information to investigate the solar system and the effects of energy on living, physical and geological systems)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students close their eyes and listen to the music. You may wish to play the
music twice. The first time students should just listen for enjoyment and the
second time they should listen to identify the different instruments they can
hear. After listening, have students pair up to compare and discuss the
instruments they heard.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Close your eyes. Listen to the music.
[Video] An Orchestral Waltz
[Discussion] What instruments can you hear? 
[Instruction Box] Compare what you heard with a classmate. 
[Image] A young child in headphones smiles against a yellow background with musical instruments around her: a violin, a piano, symbols and a trumpet.

PART 2:
[Statement Box] Each instrument is part of a bigger system—the orchestra. A system is made up of
smaller parts that work together to form something larger and more complicated.
[Image] A round trampoline with a blue border and a black jump surface, set on metal legs.
[Image] A white and orange children's bicycle with thick tyres and a black chain guard.
[Discussion] What is the name of each system?
[Discussion] What are the parts of each system?
[Discussion] What other systems can you think of?
[Plain Text] Look at these systems. 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: The purpose of this activity is to introduce students to the skeletal system and
how it includes bones and joints. It should be noted that the skeletal system
also includes cartilage and ligaments, but knowledge of these parts are beyond
the scope of this unit.

Students should be familiar with different bones in their body from the previous
lesson, but the vocabulary 'joint' will be new to them. Explain that a joint is
where two or more bones connect.

Students now find some joints on their own bodies. Guide them to make a fist
with their hand and feel the bumps on each finger, highlighting how these joints
enable movement. Students then move other parts of their bodies to identify the
elbow, knee, hip and shoulder joints.
[Statement Box] Our skeletal system is in our body. The parts of our skeletal system include our
bones and our joints.

A joint is where two or more bones connect. 
[Plain Text] Find some joints. 
[Instruction Box] Make a fist with your hand. 

The bumps on each finger are joints.

These allow our fingers to move. 
[Image] A closed fist with arrows pointing to three joints, each labelled "Joint."
[Instruction Box] Move different parts of your body to find your:

 * Elbow joint

 * Knee joint

 * Hip joint 

 * Shoulder joint

Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: This activity introduces two types of joints in our skeletal system.

Read the information about ball-and-socket joints and draw students' attention
to the animation that illustrates how a ball-and-socket joint works.

Ask students to think back to the joints they explored in the previous activity
and identify which one they think is a ball-and-socket joint. To support oral
syntax development and encourage students to explain their reasoning, they
should complete the sentence, 'I think the _________ is a ball-and-socket joint
because ...'
PART 1:
[Statement Box] We have different types of joints in our skeletal system. 
[Plain Text] Ball-and-Socket Joints
[Coloured Box] A ball-and-socket joint is where the end of one bone (the ball part) fits into a
hollow space in another bone (the socket part). These joints allow movement in
all directions, giving the most flexibility within the human body. Our shoulder
joint is an example of a ball-and-socket joint. 
[Discussion] I think the _________ is a ball-and-socket joint because ...
[Image] A boy with short hair and glasses shouts into a megaphone, gesturing with his free hand.
[Instruction Box]  Think back to the joints you explored in Activity 2.

Which one do you think is a ball-and-socket joint?

PART 2:
[Plain Text] Hinge Joints
[Coloured Box] Hinge joints work like the hinges on a door. They allow movement in one
direction such as bending and straightening. The elbow joint is an example of a
hinge joint. 
[Discussion] Which joint do you think is a hinge joint?  What makes you say that?
[Instruction Box] Think back to the joints you explored in Activity 2.

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Explain that movement requires the skeletal system to work with the muscular
system, which contains about 600 muscles.

First, ask students to sit on a chair, put their hands on their thighs and then
raise their legs up.

Next, ask them to lie on the floor with their knees bent, put their hand on
their stomach and then sit up.

Students who have mobility issues could do this with their arms:

 * Straighten one arm

 * Put your other hand on your upper arm

 * Bend your elbow joint

After completing each of these activities, ask them to describe how their
muscles felt when they moved.
[Statement Box] To make our bodies move, our skeletal system has to work with our muscular
system.

There are about 600 muscles in our muscular system. 
[Plain Text] Feel your muscles. 
[Instruction Box]  * Sit on a chair.

 * Put your hands on your thighs.

 * Straighten your legs so your feet are out in front of you. 
[Image] A child sits on a stool with legs outstretched, smiling against a light blue background.
[Instruction Box]  * Lie on the floor with your knees bent. 

 * Put your hand on your stomach.

 * Sit up. 
[Image] A child in a black t-shirt and shorts sitting with knees bent, and hands on their stomach.
[Discussion] Describe how your muscles felt when you moved.

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students are introduced to how a scientific model can help us understand how our
muscular system and skeletal systems work together. You may need to explain the
meaning of a scientific model. You could say:

A scientific model is a pretend version of something real that helps scientists
understand or explain how something works. A scientific model might be a
diagram, a 3D model, or an animation.

Students now explore the scientific model of an arm moving, clicking 'Move arm'.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] A scientific model can help us understand how our muscular system and skeletal
system work together.
[Plain Text] Explore the scientific model and then use it to answer the questions on the next
page. 
[Image] A young boy flexes his arm and grins, pointing to his bicep against a blue splatter background.

PART 2:
[Discussion] Length of the bicep
[Plain Text] When the bicep muscle tightens, what happens to the:
[Discussion] Length of the tricep
[Discussion] Lower arm bones
[Plain Text] When the bicep muscle tightens, the  ...

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students create their own scientific model demonstrating how muscles, bones and
joints work together to create movement. Organise students into pairs and
provide them with the necessary materials. It is best to use card that is about
the same thickness of a cereal box.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Make your own scientific model to show how muscles, bones and joints work
together to create movement. 
[Instruction Box] Materials

Each pair will need: 

 * 2 rectangular pieces of card (cut from a cereal box works well) 

 * 1 split pin

 * 1 elastic band, cut in half

For the class to share:

 * Staplers

 * Hole punches
[Image] Different materials: two pieces of cardboard, a stapler, a hole puncher, a blue rubber band that has been cut in half and a split pin.

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] Steps 
[Instruction Box] First, create an L-shape with your pieces of card. These represent your arm
bones. 
[Instruction Box] Next, punch a hole in each of the arm bones. Fasten the arm bones together using
the split pin. This represents the elbow joint. 
[Instruction Box] After this, attach one piece of the elastic band to the inside of arm bones.
This represents the bicep muscle.
[Instruction Box] Finally, attach the other piece of elastic band to the outside of the arm bones.
This represents the tricep muscle.
[Image] Two pieces of cardboard, arranged in an 'L' shape.
[Image] The two pieces of cardboard now have a hole where they overlap, indicated by a hole punch, with a split pin to go into the hole.
[Image] The two pieces of cardboard are now connected by a split pin. A stapler is needed to staple one half of the rubber band to the cardboard pieces, to represent the bicep muscle.
[Image] The two pieces of cardboard are now connected by: a split pin, a cut rubber band representing the bicep, and another cut rubber band representing the tricep. Behind is a faded image of someone flexing their arm, showing what the materials are representing.
[Statement Box] Some words link ideas together to help us understand when something should be
done. These are called temporal connectives. 
[Discussion] Identify the temporal connectives in the steps. 

PART 3:
[Multiple Choice]
  a) The elbow joint  ✓
  b) The upper arm bone 
  c) The lower arm bones
  d) The bicep muscle
  e) The tricep muscle

[Statement Box] A noun group is a group of words that give more meaning to a noun.

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Students read the information about prosthetics.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Occasionally, a part of our skeletal system is missing. Prosthetic limbs can
replace a missing leg, arm or hand. 

They are made out of strong materials like plastic and metal, and work like the
missing limb.
[Plain Text] Read the information about prosthetics.
[Instruction Box] Now complete the questions on the next page. 
[Image] A young girl in a black tutu poses, showcasing her prosthetic leg.
[Image] A young boy receives basketball shooting guidance from an older teenager on a court.
[Image] Two children in a classroom, one with a prosthetic arm, using laptops and headphones.
[Plain Text] The muscles in my upper arm control my prosthetic arm. 
[Plain Text] My prosthetic leg allows me to run, jump and even play basketball. 
[Plain Text] Every year, I have to go to the hospital to have a new prosthetic leg fitted
because I am still growing. 

PART 2:

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Explain that joints can sometimes stop working properly due to extensive use,
making movement painful. Describe how orthopaedic doctors can replace worn-out
joints with artificial ones. Share the example of Tiger Woods, who had a knee
replacement and then continued to win major golf tournaments. Have students read
the following statement,

'Athletes should not be allowed to compete if they have had a joint
replacement.'

Using the table provided, students then determine whether Tiger Woods'
opponents, his fans and orthopaedic doctors would agree or disagree with the
statement, explaining their reasoning.
[Statement Box] Sometimes, when they are used a lot, joints stop working properly. This makes it
painful to move around. Orthopaedic doctors can replace the worn-out joint with
a new, artificial one.

Tiger Woods is one of the most successful golfers of all time. He had a knee
joint replacement and then went on to win another major tournament. 
[Table]
+-------------------------+---------------------+
|                         | Agree or disagree?  |
+-------------------------+---------------------+
| Tiger Woods' opponents  |                     |
+-------------------------+---------------------+
| Tiger Woods' fans       |                     |
+-------------------------+---------------------+
| Orthopaedic doctors     |                     
+-------------------------+---------------------+
[Coloured Box] Athletes should not be allowed to compete if they have had a joint replacement. 
[Plain Text] Read the statement.
