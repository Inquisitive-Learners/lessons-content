Topic Name: TEST local Depending on Energy.
Topic overview: In Stage 2, students cover the focus area Physical and living systems depend on energy. The focus area has been broken down into nine Inquisitive units.  In Year 3, students cover the following units:  Earth's Systems and Environments (Coming in late 2025)  States and Properties of Matter (Coming in late 2025)  Body Systems and Movement  Transferring Heat Energy (Coming in late 2025)  Our Solar System (Coming in late 2025)  In Year 4, students cover the following units:  Energy Flow and Relationships in Ecosystems  (Coming in late 2025)  Heat Energy Changes Matter (Coming in late 2025)  Forces Change Earth's Surface Gravity in Our Solar System  (Coming in late 2025) .
--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Body Systems and Movement 
Unit overview: In this unit, students learn how body systems work together to enable movement. Through hands-on activities and digital simulations, they will learn the key parts of our skeleton that provide us with support and protection and model how our skeletal and muscular systems work together to enable us to move. By investigating the scientific question, Are people with shorter bones in their lower legs better at the limbo?  students deepen their understanding of the topic, while also learning how to plan, conduct and evaluate a fair test. The unit culminates with students exploring the difference between vertebrates and invertebrates and how this difference affects their movement.  Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete. Teaching notes for each lesson include: A lesson overview Background teacher reading notes Resources and materials if needed Detailed teaching and learning sequences for each activity with additional questioning and learning opportunities, suggestions for differentiating instruction, and sample answers References to the 5E elements developed in each activity Practical tips for conducting hands-on activities Unit and lesson teaching notes can be downloaded as an editable document..

Lesson duration: 30 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: Why is our skeleton important?

Focus question image: Two smiling girls colour on a white cast while sitting on a sofa, one holding a teddy bear.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students will examine the crucial role their skeleton has in providing them with support and protection. Beginning with an engaging video of a skeleton going on strike, they consider what would happen if their own skeleton went on strike. Students explore the parts of their own skeleton using touch, learning the scientific name for each one. An eBook introduces students to whether each part supports them or protects their organs. They demonstrate their understanding by writing a note of gratitude to each skeleton part, thanking it for what it does for them.  This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary and noun groups to enhance the specificity of texts The lesson also supports the following English outcomes:  EN2-OLC-01 EN2-VOCAB-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
- Begin the lesson by showing the students the image of the two children. Ask:

 * Why do you think one of the children is wearing a cast?

Introduce the focus question to students, 'Why is our skeleton important?'
Encourage the students to share their thoughts and any experiences they have had
with broken bones or injuries, being mindful that this might be a sensitive
subject for some students. Document and use the students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
- Students are learning to:

 * Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- By the end of this lesson, students will:

 * Name different parts of their skeleton.

 * Locate different parts of their skeleton on their own body.

 * Describe how different parts of their skeleton offer protection or support.

TEACHER KNOWLEDGE:
- Your skeleton is essential for providing structure and support to the human
body. It also protects vital organs. For example, the skull shields the brain,
and the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs.

Young students may think that the skeleton is one large bone rather than lots of
bones. Although not specifically mentioned in this lesson, an adult human has
206 bones that make up their skeleton. A baby, however, is born with
approximately 300 bones that fuse together as they get older.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
- As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why is our skeleton important?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
- This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and
support.

DETAILED ACTIVITIES:
ACTIVITY 1:
Activity ID: o3XzCWkHpkbB
Section ID: Y5GTScCBhJs0
Description: Students watch the video A Skeleton's Rant about a skeleton who goes on strike
because he is fed up of not being appreciated. It is recommended that students
watch the video twice. After the first watch, check students' understanding of
'going on strike'.

You could explain it by saying the following:

Going on strike is when a group of people or an individual decides to stop doing
their job for a while. They do this because they want to ask for something
important, like better pay, safer workplaces, or more appreciation. It’s a way
to say, 'We need things to change.'

In the video, the skeleton says he is going on strike because he doesn't feel
appreciated for the important job he does.

I told my family that I was going on strike because I was fed up with picking up
their dirty washing off the floor.

Think, Pair, Share a time when you wanted to go on strike.

Section ID: 8NHFgwv3CBQv
Description: Present the scenario where Jessie has broken her femur, explaining that it is
the longest, strongest and heaviest bone that supports body weight when
standing, walking, or running. Students then complete the Think, Feel, Care
thinking routine from the perspective of both Jessie and her femur.

To support students' thinking, ask:

 * What might Jessie be thinking or feeling after breaking her femur?

 * If Jessie's femur could talk, what would it express about being broken?

 * How does the femur's injury impact Jessie's daily life?
[Statement Box] Sometimes, parts of your skeleton go on strike! When you break a bone, it stops
doing its job properly. 
[Image] Two girls sitting on a sofa, colouring a bandaged leg, one holding a teddy bear.
[Plain Text] Jessie has broken her femur. This is the leg bone that runs from your hip to
your knee. It is the longest, strongest and heaviest bone in your body. Its job
is to support your body weight when you stand, walk or run.
