FOCUS QUESTION: How can we find out who is the best at limbo?

Focus question image: Two girls play limbo under a blue rope, while a woman encourages them in a gym setting.
TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students will learn to answer a scientific question by carrying out an experiment. With support from the teacher, students plan and conduct a fair test to find out the answer to the scientific question, Are people with shorter bones in their lower legs better at the limbo?  They analyse their results and then evaluate their experiment.   This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use temporal and causal connectives and labelled diagrams when explaining the process of conducting a fair test. This lesson also supports the following English outcomes:  EN2-OLC-01 EN2-VOCAB-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Begin the lesson by showing students the image of two children playing limbo.
Ask students if they have ever played a game of limbo and what they had to do.

Ask the focus question, 'How might we find out who is the best at limbo?'

Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students will be able to:
- Answer a a scientific question by carrying out an experiment.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify a scientific question.
- Follow steps to carry out an experiment.
- Take measurements and record these on a table.
- Draw conclusions from the results of an experiment.

TEACHER READING:
A scientific investigation involves asking a question that can be tested, making
a prediction, conducting an experiment and drawing conclusions based on the
results. A fair test means changing only one variable at a time while keeping
all other conditions the same. This ensures that the results are due to the
variable being tested, allowing for accurate conclusions. It should be noted
that the use of the term 'variable' is not required at this year level.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How can we find out who is the best at the limbo?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

ACTIVITY 4:
Description: Students complete the results table using the data collected from their
experiment. Encourage students to analyse the data to identify any trends or
patterns that indicate a relationship between the length of the lower leg bone
and limbo performance.

To support their analysis, they should answer the following questions:

 * Who had the shortest lower leg bones?

 * Were they also the best at limbo?

ACTIVITY 5:
Description: Encourage students to write a conclusion summarising what they have discovered
through their experiment. Ask them to reflect on whether their results support
their initial prediction and to provide explanations for their findings. Invite
them to consider what they might change if they conducted the experiment again
to improve accuracy or explore further aspects. Finally, ask them to suggest
other scientific questions about limbo they would like to investigate. To
scaffold student with this activity, you might like to provide them with the
sentence starters provided in Activity 1.

Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of student's
ability to answer a scientific question by carrying out an experiment.

ACTIVITY 6:
Description: Introduce students to the concept of hypermobility, explaining that athletes
like Shrishti are often hypermobile, meaning their joints can move more than
most people's, allowing them to get into difficult positions. Given that
approximately 20% of children are hypermobile, it is likely that you have
students in your class who have hypermobility in one or more of their joints. If
this is the case, you may like to ask them to share their experiences of
hypermobility.

Invite students to think about sports or activities where being hypermobile
could provide an advantage.
[Statement Box] Athletes that are very flexible, like Shrishti, are often double-jointed. The
scientific name for this is hypermobile. Being hypermobile means your joints can
move more than most people, allowing you to get into difficult positions. 
[Image] A child performs a split on a yoga mat, smiling with arms and legs stretched out.
[Plain Text] I am hypermobile in my hips.
[Table]
+--------------------+------------------+
| Sport or activity  | Why I think this |
+--------------------+------------------+
|                    |                  |
+--------------------+------------------+
|                    |                  |

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 15 minutes

ACTIVITY 7:
Description: Present students with information about the average height of NBA basketball
players and the advertisement from The Skyscrapers basketball team seeking tall
players. Ask them to critically evaluate whether the team should be allowed to
advertise exclusively for tall individuals. Encourage students to formulate
their own opinions and provide well-thought-out reasons to support their views.
Ask them to consider possible arguments from those who might hold an opposing
opinion.
[Statement Box] The average height of a male basketball player in the National Basketball
Association is 198 cm. This is over 20 cm taller than the average male in
Australia! 
[Plain Text] Read the advertisment.
[Coloured Box] The Skyscrapers basketball team is looking for some toweringly tall players to
join their team. You must be over 190 cm tall to apply—the taller the better!
