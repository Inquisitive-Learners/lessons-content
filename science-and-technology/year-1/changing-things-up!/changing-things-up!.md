**Year:** Year 1

**Lesson ID:** 678

**Lesson name:** Changing Things Up!

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How do materials change?

**Focus question image:**
Girl wearing safety goggles and gloves, working on a woodworking project in a workshop.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students identify that materials can physically change. They understand that a physical change affects the shape and size of a material. They explore the physical changes in everyday objects in their lives by participating in guided investigations where they use their senses to explore and answer questions.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Have students look at the image and discuss what they see. Ask what they think
the girl is doing with the wood. Read together the focus question, 'How do
materials change?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Identify everyday materials and understand how they can be changed.
- Success Criteria
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify and name a range of materials.
- Use a range of actions to change materials.
- Describe how materials can be physically changed.

**TEACHER READING:**
Understanding how materials can physically change and how these changes affect
their shape and size is a fundamental concept in science. Physical changes
involve alterations in a material's form, shape or state without changing its
chemical composition.

Common examples of physical changes include cutting, bending, folding, tearing,
stretching and mixing. When paper is cut into different shapes, its size and
shape are altered but it remains paper. Similarly, when clay is moulded into
different forms, the shape changes but the clay's properties remain the same.

Activities such as stretching a rubber band, folding a piece of paper or mixing
sand with water demonstrate different types of physical changes. Each activity
illustrates how the shape and size of a material can be altered through simple
actions. It is important to note that while physical changes can alter the
appearance and dimensions of a material, the inherent properties remain
unchanged.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How do materials change?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to identify everyday materials and understand how they can be changed.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
To engage students and provoke curiosity in the lesson, watch the video
Sculptures by the Sea. It may be beneficial for students to watch the video more
than once. The first time for enjoyment, and the second time to choose a
favourite sculpture.
Use the statement box to connect student learning to the real world by
explaining how scientists use their senses to observe and gather information
about objects and materials. Place students in pairs and assist them to choose
two objects made of different materials (a range of suggested objects is
provided on the page). Discuss with students the different ways they could
change the shape and size of their objects, for example, by cutting, folding,
tearing, stretching, rolling, squashing, bending, twisting, molding, crushing or
ripping.

Part 2 of 2

Students record the name of their chosen materials and the method they used to
physically change them, before completing a 'before' and 'after' drawing for
each one.
Students reflect on the previous activity by completing a mind map showing the
different ways they observed materials changing.
Introduce the concept of materials to the students by asking them to reflect on
the different types of materials that the sculptures in the video were made
from. Draw attention to the sculptures displayed on the page and ask students to
Think, Pair, Share the materials they are made from and to identify if any of
the sculptures are made from more than one type of material.
Applying their critical-thinking skills, students consider what material might
be the best material in the world. Encourage them to think about what materials
can be physically changed in a variety of ways to make a selection of objects.
Taking the learning further, students consider how materials are physically
changed in the real world to make new objects. To support students, an example
is provided showing how a diamond can be physically altered to create the stone
in a diamond ring. Students complete the activity by choosing their own material
and recording an object it could be changed into.
This activity introduces the idea that objects can be physically changed,
through a video of a child inflating a balloon. Explain to students that
physically changing an object does not change the material it is made from, but
does change what it looks like. It may be beneficial for the students to watch
the video more than once. The first time for enjoyment, and the second time with
the purpose of answering the questions on the page.

**PRACTICAL TIPS:**
To promote sustainability, it is recommended that recycled objects be used for
this activity. In the days leading up to the lesson, students could be asked to
bring in suitable items from home.
