**Year:** Year 1

**Lesson ID:** 679

**Lesson name:** Let's Get Physical

**Lesson duration:** 90 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Can you bend it, twist it, stretch it?

**Focus question image:**

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students predict and compare how the shapes of objects made from different materials can be physically changed through actions such as bending, stretching and twisting. Students observe a range of materials that bend, stretch and twist, and they identify these as flexible or elastic materials. Students collect and record observations and use drawing and tables to sort their information.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
As a class, look at the image and discuss what the child is doing. Read the
focus question, 'Can you bend it, twist it, stretch it?' Ask students what
materials they think they could bend, twist or stretch. Document and use the
students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions. 

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Investigate how materials can be changed by bending, twisting and stretching.
- Success Criteria
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify and demonstrate a range of actions such as bending, twisting,
- stretching, rolling and pushing.
- Apply knowledge of the properties of materials to make predictions.
- Test a variety of materials to see which actions can cause them to change.
- Make and record observations on a provided table.

**TEACHER READING:**
Physical changes involve a change in the form or physical properties of a
material, without any change in its chemical composition. Examples include
bending, stretching, twisting and compressing. These changes are usually
reversible.

Different materials have distinct properties that determine how they can be
manipulated. For example, metals can be bent and stretched, rubber can be
stretched and twisted, and clay can be moulded and shaped. Understanding these
properties helps in predicting how materials will behave under different
physical actions.

Bending

Bending is a physical change where a material is curved or angled. This action
is common in materials like metals and plastics, which can be changed without
breaking. Bending tests the flexibility and ductility of a material.

Stretching

Stretching involves pulling a material to increase its length. This action is
typical for elastic materials like rubber bands and certain plastics. Stretching
tests the elasticity and tensile strength of a material.

Twisting

Twisting is the action of turning a material around its axis. This is often seen
in materials like wires and ropes. Twisting tests the torsional strength and
flexibility of a material.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Can you bend it, twist it, stretch it?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kind of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to investigate how materials can be changed by bending, twisting and
stretching.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Use the statement box to explain to students that some materials can be changed
by using different actions such as bending, stretching and twisting. Emphasise
that for a material to be bent, stretched or twisted, it needs to be flexible or
elastic. Some materials, like the candy, need to be warmed to become flexible.
Use the interactive matching activity to further explore the key vocabulary:
bend, twist, stretch, roll and push.
Students carry out an investigation to test a range of different materials to
see if they can change them. Allow students to closely observe each object and
identify the material it is made of. Predict which they think may bend, stretch
or twist. Discuss other actions they could do to change the materials.

Part 2 of 3

As students test each material, they record their results in a table. Using a
table helps students organise their observations and communicate their findings
effectively. Students draw each object, record the material it is made of and
tick or cross to show if it can be bent, stretched or twisted. To complete the
activity, they record any other ways they can physically change each material.

Part 3 of 3

Students reflect on their observations by completing a series of sentences. In
addition to how they were able to stretch, bend or twist the materials, they
also write about one of their own actions and how it changed the material. The
worked example on the page provides a model of what students need to do.
This activity encourages creative thinking and explores the concept of changing
materials to create new shapes. After watching a claymation video, students
consider what material was used to create the characters and objects and why
this was a good material to use. To complete the activity, students create their
own character using modelling materials. They should take a photo or draw their
character, and then label the changes they made to the materials to form the
shapes they needed.
This activity encourages critical thinking and helps students explore the
advantages and disadvantages of material properties in a fun and engaging way.
Students read about a superhero with elastic superpowers. This superhero is very
flexible and can easily change shape. Through the completion of a Plus, Minus,
Interesting chart, students consider what would be good, bad and interesting
about having these superpowers.
Begin the lesson by showing the video, Rainbow Candy Making. This video
demonstrates how candy is warmed, twisted, stretched and rolled, providing a
visual example of how materials can be physically changed. It may be beneficial
for students to watch the video more than once. The first time for enjoyment and
the second time to complete the See, Think, Wonder visible thinking activity.
