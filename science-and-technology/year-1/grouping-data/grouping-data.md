Topic Name: TEST local Investigating Changes.
Topic overview: In Stage 1, students cover the focus area Investigations of changes provide knowledge and understanding. The focus area has been broken down into eight Inquisitive units.  In Year 1, students cover the following units:  Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats (Coming in late 2025)  Body Sense Organs  (Coming in late 2025)  Light in Action (Coming in late 2025)  Planet Earth (Coming in late 2025)  In Year 2, students cover the following units:  Power of Forces  Changes Over Time (Coming in late 2025)  Sound Journey (Coming in late 2025)  Exploring the Sky (Coming in late 2025) .
--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore how living things and habitats change over time. They begin by learning what data is and its uses, including collecting observations in a park. Students then discover how to group data from a pond habitat to reveal information, applying this skill to their own local observations. The unit progresses to observing and describing visible changes in habitats and living things over time, using data to represent these shifts. Finally, students conduct a scientific investigation into plant growth, collecting and analysing data to describe how a bean plant changes as it grows, answering a specific scientific question. Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete. Teaching notes for each lesson include: A lesson overview Background teacher reading notes Resources and materials if needed Detailed teaching and learning sequences for each activity with additional questioning and learning opportunities, suggestions for differentiating instruction, and sample answers References to the 5E elements developed in each activity Practical tips for conducting hands-on activities Unit and lesson teaching notes can be downloaded as an editable document..

Lesson duration: 30 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: Why do we group data?

Focus question image: Two beagles playfully walk through a park covered in autumn leaves.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students are introduced to how we can group data. Using a pond habitat as the context, students observe living things within the habitat and group them in different ways. They learn that we group data to help us find out information, before collecting and grouping their own data in a local habitat.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Begin the lesson by showing students the image. To ensure they have remembered
what data is from the previous lesson, ask them what data about living things
they might collect if they were in the park. Then pose the focus question, 'Why
do we group data?' Record students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Collect, record and group data about animals in a local habitat.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify animals in a habitat.
- Record observations of animals using words or pictures.
- Group collected data based on a chosen characteristic or behaviour.
- Explain why they have grouped their data in a particular way.

TEACHER READING:
Habitats

Habitats are specific places where animals and plants live. These places provide
living things with the things they need to live. An environment, however, is
everything surrounding the habitat and includes both living and non-living
things.

Grouping Data

Grouping data is a key scientific skill and allows students to identify patterns
and relationships. There can be multiple ways to group the same data depending
on the information you want to find out.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why do we group data?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to
collect, record and group data about animals in a local habitat.

MATERIALS NEEDED:

  Materials: Clipboard, Hand lens, Paper, Colour pencil, Pencil

Activity LLvVwV7Kgw4b:
  1. Yes, I think this is a good way to group the animals because animals from the
same part of the world might need a similar habitat.
  2. The zoo has grouped its animals by where in the world they are from.
  3.  * Animals that you can feed could go in one section of the zoo, while animals
   you cannot feed (because they are too dangerous) could go in another.

 * Animals that are nocturnal could go in one section, while animals that are
   not nocturnal could go in another.

 * Animals could also be grouped according to how endangered they are.

closely at the interactive map of Perth Zoo and consider how the animals have
been grouped.

Students are then asked to consider whether they think this method of grouping
is a good one or not. The important part of this question is not whether the
students answer yes or no, but that they explain their thinking.
