**Year:** Year 1

**Lesson ID:** 6578

**Lesson name:** Grouping Data

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Why do we group data?

**Focus question image:**
Two beagles playfully walk through a park covered in autumn leaves.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students are introduced to how we can group data. Using a pond habitat as the context, students observe living things within the habitat and group them in different ways. They learn that we group data to help us find out information, before collecting and grouping their own data in a local habitat.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Begin the lesson by showing students the image. To ensure they have remembered
what data is from the previous lesson, ask them what data about living things
they might collect if they were in the park. Then pose the focus question, 'Why
do we group data?' Record students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Collect, record and group data about animals in a local habitat.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify animals in a habitat.
- Record observations of animals using words or pictures.
- Group collected data based on a chosen characteristic or behaviour.
- Explain why they have grouped their data in a particular way.

**TEACHER READING:**
Habitats

Habitats are specific places where animals and plants live. These places provide
living things with the things they need to live. An environment, however, is
everything surrounding the habitat and includes both living and non-living
things.

Grouping Data

Grouping data is a key scientific skill and allows students to identify patterns
and relationships. There can be multiple ways to group the same data depending
on the information you want to find out.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why do we group data?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to
collect, record and group data about animals in a local habitat.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Clipboard, Hand lens, Paper, Colour pencil, Pencil

  Materials: Sticky note

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST1-DAT-01 (collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: As a class, read the eBook Who Lives Here? After reading, ask students:

 * What was the same about all the places in the eBook?

At this stage in the lesson, accept any reasonable response.
[Plain Text] Read the eBook. 
[Discussion] What was the same about all the places in the eBook? 
[E-book] Who lives here?
[Image] Child in striped top looking through binoculars with a joyful expression.

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Explain to students that each place in the eBook was a habitat and that this is
a place where plants and animals get the things they need to live.

Either as a class or on individual devices, students explore the virtual pond
habitat by dragging the hand lens across the page. Ask students to identify what
animals they can see.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] All the places in the eBook were habitats. A habitat is a place where plants and
animals get the things they need to live. 
[Plain Text] Explore the pond habitat. 
[Discussion] What animals can you see?

PART 2:
[Plain Text] Look again at the pond habitat.
[Image] A thoughtful boy in glasses below a colourful nature illustration of a pond scene.

PART 3:
[Plain Text] With a classmate, write the animals on sticky notes.

Group the animals in a different way. 

Label your groups. 
[Plain Text] Share your groups with another pair.
[Image] Four children in bright t-shirts smiling and hugging in a classroom setting.

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 20 minutes
Materials: Sticky note

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: This activity introduces why we group data. It shows an example of grouped data
(animals grouped by 'Have legs' or 'Have no legs') and asks students to complete
a sentence explaining the purpose of this grouping. It is suggested that the
sentence is completed as a whole class.
[Statement Box] We can group data to help us find out information. 
[Plain Text] Some students have grouped the animals in the pond habitat according to whether
they have legs or have no legs. 
[Image] A duck flying, a green frog, a turtle, and a butterfly with orange wings illustrated.
[Image] Cartoon fish on the left, small tadpoles on the right.
[Plain Text] Have legs 
[Plain Text] Have no legs

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students explore a local habitat (e.g. school garden, local park or playground)
and look for animals that live there. To help them remember what animals they
observed, they record them as data using words or pictures.
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] Visit a local habitat with your class.
[Instruction Box] Look carefully for animals that live in the habitat.
[Instruction Box] Record the animals you find as data using words or pictures. 
[Image] Child observing ladybirds in grass with a magnifying glass, smiling intently.
[Image] A smiling boy holds a clipboard with drawings of a ladybug and a worm in a green setting.

PART 2:

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 30 minutes
Checkpoint: This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to
collect, record and group data about animals in a local habitat.
Materials: Clipboard, Hand lens, Paper, Colour pencil, Pencil

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Connecting to the real world, students learn that zoos group animals. They look
closely at the interactive map of Perth Zoo and consider how the animals have
been grouped.

Students are then asked to consider whether they think this method of grouping
is a good one or not. The important part of this question is not whether the
students answer yes or no, but that they explain their thinking.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Zoos group their animals. 
[Plain Text] Look at the map of Perth Zoo.

[Multiple Choice]
  a) Yes  ✓
  b) No

PART 2:

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 20 minutes

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students use a Venn diagram to organise the data. Encourage them to see how
different categories can sometimes share similarities.

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 5 minutes
