**Year:** Year 1

**Lesson ID:** 680

**Lesson name:** Heating and Cooling

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What happens when we heat or cool things?

**Focus question image:**
Marshmallow snowman with pretzel arms relaxing in a red mug of hot chocolate.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will explore how different materials change when warmed and cooled. They will identify that cooling materials can cause them to freeze and change physically. Students will then explore how materials are warmed and changed in a variety of different ways (e.g. melting, getting harder). Conducting a practical investigation, students will use their senses to observe frozen fruit, and describe and identify what changes happen when the fruit is thawed.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Look at the image and ask students to describe what they see. Ask them if they
think the snowman will keep smiling and why they think that. Read the focus
question, 'What happens when we heat or cool things?' Document and use the
students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Understand that materials can change when warmed or cooled.
- Success Criteria
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify the effects of warming and cooling materials.
- Use their senses to explore how materials can change when warmed or cooled.
- Follow safe procedures for handling food during a guided investigation.

**TEACHER READING:**
Heating and cooling are processes that involve adding or removing energy from
something. When energy is added, particles move faster and temperature increases
(heating). When energy is removed, particles slow down and temperature decreases
(cooling).

Heating a material causes the material to change state (e.g. from solid to
liquid). In contrast, when materials are exposed to freezing temperatures, the
water within them can freeze, causing the materials to become hard and brittle.
Thawing reverses this process, returning the materials to their original state.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What happens when we heat or cool things?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kind of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding that materials can change when warmed or cooled.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
The concept of heating is further explored, in particular the idea that when
materials are warmed they can change. Read the eBook Heating Up! together, using
the multiple-choice questions to assess students understanding of the topic.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
To engage students in the lesson, have them watch the video What Happened to My
Dress? It may be beneficial for students to watch the video more than once. The
first time for enjoyment and the second time to answer the questions on the
page.
Use the statement box to explain that different materials can freeze and change
when exposed to cold temperatures. Use the provided images to prompt discussion
about what each frozen thing would feel like. Then introduce the concept of
heating by asking students to consider how each thing would change if it was
heated.
Students observe and explore the changes that happen when something is cold and
is then heated by completing a Frozen Fruit Investigation. This activity
encourages students to use their senses to explore and describe changes in
materials.

Place students in pairs and provide each pair with a small plate of frozen
fruit. Tell students they will be using their five senses to explore the fruit.
Use the visual cues on the page to remind students of the five senses.

Part 2 of 3

Students draw their fruit on the page and add descriptive words explaining what
the fruit looks, smell, tastes, sounds and feels like.

Part 3 of 3

Use the statement box to explain that when frozen material is warmed or heated,
it thaws and changes. Ask students to explore some different ways of thawing
their fruit. They then use their senses to investigate the thawed fruit, drawing
what it looks like and writing descriptive words around the plate.
Taking the learning further, students consider that humans can also heat up and
cool down. They draw some things that heat them up and cool them down, before
writing which they prefer: feeling hot or feeling cold.
Students are presented with a series of photos of materials that have been
heated. They draw and label what each material looked like before it was heated.

**PRACTICAL TIPS:**
Before handling the fruit, ensure students wash their hands thoroughly. Teacher
judgement should be used when deciding if students should be allowed to taste
the fruit.
