**Year:** Year 1

**Lesson ID:** 6579

**Lesson name:** Comparing Data

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What might change in a habitat?

**Focus question image:** Pink and white water lilies float on a tranquil pond surrounded by green lily pads.
**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students observe how living things in a habitat change over time. They are shown the same habitat at two different points in time and asked to identify visible changes. They collect and represent this data and use it to describe the changes they have observed.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What might change in a
habitat?' Encourage students to reflect on changes they have noticed in their
local environment, such as leaves turning brown or new creatures appearing, and
discuss why these changes happen. Document and use students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Collect and represent data to identify and describe changes in living things
- within a habitat.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify things that have changed and things that have stayed the same in a
- habitat over time.
- Describe how the actions of living things in a habitat have changed.
- Use a simple data display to show how the number of living things in a
- habitat has changed.
- Explain what a data display tells us about changes in the number of living
- things.

TEACHER READING:
Identifying and describing changes in living things within a habitat involves
careful observation and comparison of 'before' and 'now' states to notice what
has changed and what has remained constant.

A way of representing data is through a data display. Data displays include
graphs, tables, maps and charts. Showing data this way makes it easy to
understand and allows us to identify patterns and changes.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What might change in a habitat?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words,
which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds
of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The
vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. 

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a students'

ability to represent data and use it to describe changes in living things within
a habitat.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**
NSW Syllabus:
1. ST1-SCI-01 (measures and describes changes in living things, materials, movement, Earth and the sky)
2. ST1-DAT-01 (collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**
**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: This activity introduces the core skill of comparing in an engaging way.
Students are presented with a Spot the Difference task and then asked to Think,
Pair, Share how they found the differences.
[Plain Text] Play Spot the Difference.
[Discussion] Think, Pair, Share how you found the differences. 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Explain that just like in Spot the Difference, scientists compare data to see
how living things and habitats change over time. Show students the pond habitat
from the previous lesson and what the pond habitat looks like now. Ask:

 * What has stayed the same?

 * What has changed?
[Plain Text] Compare the same pond habitat at two different times of the year.
[Statement Box] To find the differences, you compared the pictures.

[Discussion] What has stayed the same? 
[Discussion] What has changed?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Introduce the idea that some animals' actions have changed in the pond habitat.
In pairs, students choose one animal: frog, duck, butterfly or turtle. One
partner acts out what the animal was doing before and the other partner acts out
what the animal is doing now.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Some animals' actions changed.

[Image] A serene pond scene with frogs leaping, a turtle on a log, fish and tadpoles underwater, a duck and her ducklings on the surface of the water, and dragonflies, butterflies and bees flying around. - [object Object]
[Plain Text] Act it Out! 

 * With a classmate, choose one of the following animals: frog, duck, butterfly
   or turtle. 

 * One partner acts out what the animal was doing before.

 * The other partner acts out what the animal is doing now. 

 * Choose another animal to act out. 
[Image] A cheerful girl in a yellow shirt poses between two flying ducks.

PART 2:
[Plain Text] We can describe an animal's action by using a verb.

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: This activity highlights another change in the habitat: the number of each
animal.

Have students study the pond habitats again and then pose the following
questions:

 * How many frogs were there before?

 * How many are there now?

 * How could we show this difference clearly?

The final question is designed to encourage students to think about how they
could represent the data.
[Statement Box] The number of each animal changed.

[Discussion] How many are there now?
[Discussion] How could you show this difference clearly? 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: This activity introduces the students to using a data display. They will likely
have covered data displays in maths in Early Stage 1, so the concept should be
familiar to them.

Students are asked to look at the data display and answer the following
questions:

 * Which tower tells you how many frogs there were before and which shows you
   how many there are now?

 * How could you label the towers?

Students then complete the sentence to describe what the data display tells
them.
[Statement Box] We can show how the number of something has changed by using a data display.

[Discussion] Which tower shows you how many frogs there were before and which shows you how
many there are now? 
[Discussion] How could you label the towers?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students pick one of the pond animals and use blocks to create a data display
showing its count before and now.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Choose one of these animals from the pond habitat. 
[Plain Text] Use blocks to create a data display to show the number of animals in the habitat
before and now.

Duration: 10 minutes
Checkpoint: This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a students'

ability to represent data and use it to describe changes in living things within
a habitat.

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: This activity introduces the concept that not all changes happen at the same
speed. Students first group the listed changes according to whether they are a
slow or fast change. Then they list another change they might see in a habitat
and decide whether they think it is a slow or fast change.
[Statement Box] Some changes in a habitat happen slowly and some happen fast. 
[Multiple Choice]
  a) Slow change ✓
  b) Fast change 

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Students predict how many frogs will be in the pond one month from now. They
should use 'before' and 'now' pond scenes to help them with their predictions.
