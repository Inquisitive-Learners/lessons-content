Topic Name: TEST local Investigating Changes.
Topic overview: In Stage 1, students cover the focus area Investigations of changes provide knowledge and understanding. The focus area has been broken down into eight Inquisitive units.  In Year 1, students cover the following units:  Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats (Coming in late 2025)  Body Sense Organs  (Coming in late 2025)  Light in Action (Coming in late 2025)  Planet Earth (Coming in late 2025)  In Year 2, students cover the following units:  Power of Forces  Changes Over Time (Coming in late 2025)  Sound Journey (Coming in late 2025)  Exploring the Sky (Coming in late 2025) .
--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore how living things and habitats change over time. They begin by learning what data is and its uses, including collecting observations in a park. Students then discover how to group data from a pond habitat to reveal information, applying this skill to their own local observations. The unit progresses to observing and describing visible changes in habitats and living things over time, using data to represent these shifts. Finally, students conduct a scientific investigation into plant growth, collecting and analysing data to describe how a bean plant changes as it grows, answering a specific scientific question. Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete. Teaching notes for each lesson include: A lesson overview Background teacher reading notes Resources and materials if needed Detailed teaching and learning sequences for each activity with additional questioning and learning opportunities, suggestions for differentiating instruction, and sample answers References to the 5E elements developed in each activity Practical tips for conducting hands-on activities Unit and lesson teaching notes can be downloaded as an editable document..

FOCUS QUESTION: What might change in a habitat?

Focus question image: Pink and white water lilies float on a tranquil pond surrounded by green lily pads.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students observe how living things in a habitat change over time. They are shown the same habitat at two different points in time and asked to identify visible changes. They collect and represent this data and use it to describe the changes they have observed.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What might change in a
habitat?' Encourage students to reflect on changes they have noticed in their
local environment, such as leaves turning brown or new creatures appearing, and
discuss why these changes happen. Document and use students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Collect and represent data to identify and describe changes in living things
- within a habitat.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify things that have changed and things that have stayed the same in a
- habitat over time.
- Describe how the actions of living things in a habitat have changed.
- Use a simple data display to show how the number of living things in a
- habitat has changed.
- Explain what a data display tells us about changes in the number of living
- things.

TEACHER READING:
Identifying and describing changes in living things within a habitat involves
careful observation and comparison of 'before' and 'now' states to notice what
has changed and what has remained constant.

A way of representing data is through a data display. Data displays include
graphs, tables, maps and charts. Showing data this way makes it easy to
understand and allows us to identify patterns and changes.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What might change in a habitat?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words,
which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds
of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The
vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. 

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a students'

ability to represent data and use it to describe changes in living things within
a habitat.

ACTIVITY 8:
Activity ID: y7iPTFkWzFXT
Section ID: nCe4j8h8BXHX
Description: Students predict how many frogs will be in the pond one month from now. They
should use 'before' and 'now' pond scenes to help them with their predictions.

ACTIVITY 7:
Activity ID: L6yWhdv1tB78
Section ID: PhHS435MTYJy
Description: This activity introduces the concept that not all changes happen at the same
speed. Students first group the listed changes according to whether they are a
slow or fast change. Then they list another change they might see in a habitat
and decide whether they think it is a slow or fast change.
[Statement Box] Some changes in a habitat happen slowly and some happen fast. 
[Multiple Choice]
  a) Slow change ✓
  b) Fast change 

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 10 minutes

ACTIVITY 2:
Activity ID: uaCdCtfiJBNi
Section ID: 1C7nu6RyCd8T
Description: Explain that just like in Spot the Difference, scientists compare data to see
how living things and habitats change over time. Show students the pond habitat
from the previous lesson and what the pond habitat looks like now. Ask:

 * What has stayed the same?

 * What has changed?
[Plain Text] Compare the same pond habitat at two different times of the year.
[Statement Box] To find the differences, you compared the pictures.

Duration: 10 minutes

ACTIVITY 5:
Activity ID: F5HR4HS59WRz
Section ID: KFQwVdtV1rnp
Description: This activity introduces the students to using a data display. They will likely
have covered data displays in maths in Early Stage 1, so the concept should be
familiar to them.

Students are asked to look at the data display and answer the following
questions:

 * Which tower tells you how many frogs there were before and which shows you
   how many there are now?

 * How could you label the towers?

Students then complete the sentence to describe what the data display tells
them.
[Statement Box] We can show how the number of something has changed by using a data display.

[Discussion] Which tower shows you how many frogs there were before and which shows you how
many there are now?
