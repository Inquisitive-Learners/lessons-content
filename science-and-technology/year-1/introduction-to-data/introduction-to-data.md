Lesson name: Introduction to Data
Lesson duration: 30 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: What is data?

Focus question image: Two children crouch in a sunlit garden, exploring the grass with a magnifying glass.
TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students are introduced to what data is and why it is helpful. They learn that data can be words and pictures, and explore the data that could be collected within a park context.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask them what the children might be doing and why.
Pose the focus question, 'What is data?' Record students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Recognise what data is and why it is helpful.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that data helps us remember what we have observed.
- Know that data can be words or pictures.
- Identify and suggest examples of data that could be recorded about living
- things in a park.

TEACHER READING:
Data is any kind of information that can be collected or recorded. Data can be
words, numbers, pictures, sounds and symbols. Scientists collect and record data
for a number of reasons. These include to:

 * Answer questions

 * Observe patterns and changes

 * Test ideas

 * Share findings

 * Remember what they observed

In this lesson, the focus is on collecting and recording data as pictures and
words in order to remember what has been observed.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What is data?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words,
which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds
of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The
vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. 

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to
recognise what data is and why it is helpful.

LESSON OUTCOMES:
NSW Syllabus:
1. ST1-DAT-01 (collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships)

DETAILED ACTIVITIES:
ACTIVITY 1:
Description: The lesson begins with students playing a memory game. They are asked to look at
eight nouns and are given 60 seconds to remember as many as they can.

It may be helpful to review with students that a noun is a word that names a
person, place, or thing.

After playing the game, encourage students to share how many they remembered
with a classmate.
[Plain Text] You have 60 seconds to remember as many of the nouns under the cloth as
possible. 
[Discussion] How many did you remember? Share them with a classmate. 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

ACTIVITY 2:
Description: This activity moves students into thinking about what they could do to help them
remember more nouns if they played again. To prompt their thinking, a pencil,
notebook and some coloured pencils are shown on the screen.
[Discussion] If you played the memory game again, what could you do to help you remember the
nouns? 
[Plain Text] Hint! These objects might help you. 
[Image] A yellow pencil, a blank spiral notebook, and colourful pencils on a light background.

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

ACTIVITY 3:
Description: Students replay the memory game, this time recording each noun using words or
pictures (data). Invite them to notice how writing or drawing can help them
remember details more clearly. Ask students to share their recorded data with
others to compare approaches.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] To help us remember things, we can record what we have observed using words or
pictures. We call the words and pictures data.
[Plain Text] Play the memory game again, but this time write or draw the nouns you observe.
[Image] Open spiral-bound notebook with blank pages and a yellow pencil resting on the edge.

PART 2:
[Discussion] How many nouns did you remember this time?
[Plain Text] Look at your data. Discuss the questions with a classmate.
[Image] Two children in a classroom, one pondering thoughtfully, the other focused on a notepad.
[Discussion] How did recording data help you remember? 
[Discussion] Did you use word data, picture data, or both? 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

ACTIVITY 4:
Description: Read the purple box to the students, explicitly stating that scientists record
data to remember what they observe.

Explain that a Year 1 class has been observing living things in the park. Show
them two of the students' notebooks and ask:

 * Who recorded data? How do you know?

Students should recognise that Georgie has recorded data but Max has not. This
is because Max's notebook contains a drawing of an animal you would not find in
the park (a dinosaur) and a sentence about how he felt about going to the park.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Year 1 has been observing living things in the park. 

Look at two students' notebooks. 
[Plain Text] Georgie's notebook
[Plain Text] Max's notebook
[Discussion] Who recorded data? How do you know? 
[Statement Box] Scientists record data to remember what they observe. 

PART 2:

PART 3:

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 20 minutes
Checkpoint: This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to
recognise what data is and why it is helpful.

ACTIVITY 5:
Description: Students revisit Georgie’s notebook and think of describing words that could be
written before tree to show its appearance. Prompt them to identify these
special words as adjectives.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Look at Georgie's notebook again.
[Discussion] What words could she write before 'tree' to help her remember what it looked
like? 
[Discussion] What do we call these types of words? 
[Image] A young girl rests her chin on her hand, daydreaming of a tree in a thought bubble.

PART 2:
[Statement Box] When recording data using words, we can use adjectives to help remember what
things look like. 
[Plain Text] Word Bank

colourful

slimy

spiky

delicate

pink
[Image] Lush green grass with varying heights against a plain white background.

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 20 minutes

ACTIVITY 6:
Description: Students consider whether it is better to record data as words or as pictures,
explaining their thinking.
[Image] A row of tall, vibrant green grass against a white background.

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 10 minutes

ACTIVITY 7:
Description: Students imagine visiting a park filled with animals made up of two or more
creatures. Encourage them to use words and pictures to record data about each
mixed-up animal they see.
[Image] A cartoon duck with a yellow body and long, orange fluffy tail, standing upright on two front webbed feet and two back paws.
[Plain Text] Some mixed-up animals have started appearing in the park. All these animals are
made up of two or more different animals.
[Plain Text] Imagine you have visited the park. Use words and pictures to record data about
two animals you saw. 
[Plain Text] Feathery, fluffy duckog

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 20 minutes
