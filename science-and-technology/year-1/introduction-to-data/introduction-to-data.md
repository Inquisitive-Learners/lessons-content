--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore how living things and habitats change over time. They begin by learning what data is and its uses, including collecting observations in a park. Students then discover how to group data from a pond habitat to reveal information, applying this skill to their own local observations. The unit progresses to observing and describing visible changes in habitats and living things over time, using data to represent these shifts. Finally, students conduct a scientific investigation into plant growth, collecting and analysing data to describe how a bean plant changes as it grows, answering a specific scientific question. Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete. Teaching notes for each lesson include: A lesson overview Background teacher reading notes Resources and materials if needed Detailed teaching and learning sequences for each activity with additional questioning and learning opportunities, suggestions for differentiating instruction, and sample answers References to the 5E elements developed in each activity Practical tips for conducting hands-on activities Unit and lesson teaching notes can be downloaded as an editable document..

Lesson name: Introduction to Data
Lesson duration: 30 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: What is data?

Focus question image: Two children crouch in a sunlit garden, exploring the grass with a magnifying glass.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students are introduced to what data is and why it is helpful. They learn that data can be words and pictures, and explore the data that could be collected within a park context.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask them what the children might be doing and why.
Pose the focus question, 'What is data?' Record students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Recognise what data is and why it is helpful.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that data helps us remember what we have observed.
- Know that data can be words or pictures.
- Identify and suggest examples of data that could be recorded about living
- things in a park.

TEACHER READING:
Data is any kind of information that can be collected or recorded. Data can be
words, numbers, pictures, sounds and symbols. Scientists collect and record data
for a number of reasons. These include to:

 * Answer questions

 * Observe patterns and changes

 * Test ideas

 * Share findings

 * Remember what they observed

In this lesson, the focus is on collecting and recording data as pictures and
words in order to remember what has been observed.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What is data?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words,
which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds
of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The
vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. 

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to
recognise what data is and why it is helpful.

Description: Read the purple box to the students, explicitly stating that scientists record
data to remember what they observe.

Explain that a Year 1 class has been observing living things in the park. Show
them two of the students' notebooks and ask:

 * Who recorded data? How do you know?

Students should recognise that Georgie has recorded data but Max has not. This
is because Max's notebook contains a drawing of an animal you would not find in
the park (a dinosaur) and a sentence about how he felt about going to the park.
