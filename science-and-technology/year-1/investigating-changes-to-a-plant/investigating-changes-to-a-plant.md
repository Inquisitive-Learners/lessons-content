**Year:** Year 1

**Lesson ID:** 6580

**Lesson name:** Investigating Changes to a Plant

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How does a plant change as it grows?

**Focus question image:**
Tall bean plants with green leaves and pods against a clear blue sky.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore how a plant grows and changes over time. By conducting a scientific investigation into the growth of a bean seed, students observe and collect data to describe how their plant changes. Students demonstrate their understanding by analysing their results and answering the scientific question, ‘How tall does a bean plant grow in 10 days?’  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show the students the image of the climbing bean plants and ask them the focus
question, 'How does a plant change as it grows?' Encourage them to share their
ideas and experiences about how plants grow and the changes they observe in
plants around them. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Observe and collect data to describe how a plant changes as it grows.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify that plants change over time.
- Plant a seed and make an initial observation (day 1 data).
- Use drawing and measurement (e.g. toy blocks) to record changes in a growing
- plant.
- Describe some changes a plant makes as it grows.

**TEACHER READING:**
Plants grow through a process called germination, where a seed begins to sprout
and develop into a new plant. This involves the emergence of roots, stems and
leaves as the plant utilises water, sunlight and nutrients from the soil.

Measuring plant growth involves tracking changes in height, leaf number and
overall development over time.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How does a plant change as it grows?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words,
which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds
of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The
vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to observe and collect data to describe how a plant changes as it grows.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Present the image of the leafy plant with a child's drawing of a castle in the
background. Encourage students to observe the image carefully and consider which
fairy tale it might represent.
Students watch the video Jack and the Beanstalk – The Full Story. Draw their
attention to the growth and characteristics of the beanstalk in the story.
Encourage them to consider how the story relates to real plant growth and
change.

Part 2 of 2

Students learn that bamboo is the fastest growing plant on Earth, growing about
one metre per day, and the height of clouds is about 2,000 metres from the
ground. Using this information they calculate how long it would take a bamboo
plant to reach the clouds, and use this information to consider whether it is
really possible for a bean plant to grow overnight to reach the clouds.
Read the list of materials needed to complete the Bean Growth Experiment and
assist students to collect the materials they will need.

Part 2 of 5

As a class, read and discuss the steps involved in setting up the experiment.

Part 3 of 5

Students state the aim of the experiment and record their prediction. They draw
and label what they will do to grow the seed, including all the steps of the
planting process.

Part 4 of 5

Guide students to record their results by making daily observations of their
bean plant's growth. They should document their findings through drawings,
photos or written notes, including measurements of the plant's height using Lego
bricks. This allows students to track the changes and demonstrate their
understanding of data collection in a scientific investigation.

Part 5 of 5

Students study their recorded observations and write a conclusion summarising
what they found out. They consider whether their experiment worked as expected
and reflect on the process by recording what they might do differently if they
conducted it again.
Explain that scientists ask questions, then plan and conduct experiments to find
answers, testing if their ideas are correct. Direct students' attention to the
image of the scientist measuring plants and ask them to consider what the
scientist might be investigating. Then discuss how they could design an
experiment to test how high and fast a bean plant really grows. Guide students
to think about the steps involved in planning an experiment, helping them to
understand the scientific process.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Disposable plastic cup, Permanent markers, Metal spoon, Skewers, Spray bottle, Soil, Bean seed, Linking blocks

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

background. Encourage students to observe the image carefully and consider what
fairy tale it might represent.

ask students:

 * Could a bean plant really grow overnight to reach the clouds?
