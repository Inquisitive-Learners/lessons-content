**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 690

**Lesson name:** Material Talk

**Lesson duration:** 120 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Do we really live in a material world?

**Focus question image:**
Stone structure in a rugged landscape, surrounded by mountains and a dirt path.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
This lesson introduces students to the properties of natural and processed materials. They use their sense of hearing to identify different materials and use their sense of sight and touch to describe the materials’ properties. They apply what they have learnt by writing Who am I? property clue cards for a partner to solve.  

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and discuss what they see. Ask them to identify any
known materials, before reading together the question, 'Do we really live in a
material world?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Learning Intention
- Students will be able to:
- Describe the properties of different materials.

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

Natural Materials

Natural materials are materials that come from plants, animals and rocks, or are
found naturally and can be used by humans to make things. Some examples are
wood, to build shelters; clay, which can be made into pots, cups and bowls; and
wool, which can be spun and knitted into jumpers. Natural resources in the earth
also contribute to materials and objects all around us.

Processed Materials

Processed materials are materials obtained through chemical processes. Often,
natural materials contribute to the manufacturing of processed materials. Glass
is made from sand developed from a range of processes. Other examples are
aluminium, steel, paper etc.

Composite Materials

A composite material is a combination of two materials with different physical
and chemical properties. When they are combined, they create a material that is
specialised to do a certain job, for instance, to become stronger, lighter, or
resistant to electricity. Some examples are concrete, fibreglass and asphalt.

Properties

Properties of a material generally refers to the features we can sense, measure
or test. For example, copper is cold, hard and can, depending on its form, have
some movement or malleability. In testing it, we would find that it can conduct
heat. In fact, it is ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical
conductivity. 

The properties of a material influence its use. For example:

 * To produce heat, we use materials that conduct heat.

 * To stop something from getting wet, we would use a waterproof/water-resistant
   material.

 * To reduce carrying many objects, we may create a vessel such as a basket to
   carry items more easily and use materials at-hand to make it (weave basket
   from palm fronds).

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Do we really live in a material world?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe the properties of different materials.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
This activity draws on words/vocabulary related to our senses and the properties
of materials. As such, it is recommended to have a word wall for this unit so
that students can extend their scientific vocabulary and use it in activities.

Discuss as a whole class how we can use our senses to describe materials.

 

Do a quick brainstorm of sounds that certain materials make (try not to use
activity examples). Play the soundscape activity and instruct students that they
must be quiet so that everyone has the opportunity to hear the sounds.

Support students to listen to the sounds on the video and decide what material
they think is making each sound. (Students use their sense of hearing to observe
and identify different materials.) Discuss the sounds and what they were.

As an extension, you may like to get students to record a sound of a material
(not yet covered) and play it to their partner, allowing each to guess the
other’s choice.

If the class does not have access to digital devices to do this, a fun way may
be to sit back to back and make the sound.
This activity introduces the key vocabulary 'properties'. Use the information on
the page to explicitly teach that the words we use to describe materials are
called their properties. 

As a class, read through the list of properties. Ask students to choose a
property they are unfamiliar with and complete the Colour, Symbol, Image visible
thinking activity. It may be beneficial for students to find the definition of
the word before completing the task.
In a small group students play the Who am I? game to investigate the properties
of different materials. First, students read the clues provided and then use
their sense of sight and touch to deduce which material is being described. It
may be beneficial to model for students how to use the water and pipette to test
if a material is waterproof or absorbent. The activity culminates with students
secretly choosing two of the remaining materials and writing their own property
clues for a classmate to guess.
This activity takes the learning further as students use the link provided and
trusted books and websites to independently research the properties of gold.
They then apply their learning and creativity to write a newspaper headline and
subheading that might have appeared in an ancient Egyptian newspaper the day
gold was discovered.
Before starting this activity, you may wish to revisit antonyms and synonyms.

Have students complete a gallery walk to find another student who has chosen a
word that is the antonym of their word.

Students should then look back at the list of properties in Question 5 and match
words to their antonyms, writing them in the jigsaw pieces.

Answers

waterproof - absorbent

dull - shiny

strong - weak

transparent - opaque

flexible - rigid

light - heavy

rough - smooth

hard -soft

-- Possible lesson-break point --
To engage students in the topic of materials, have them look closely at the
image of the treehouse, which has been predominantly made from wood with an
aluminium or steel and glass window.

Example answers

Students may like to live here because it is:

 *  A tree house 

 * Elevated, and so you need to climb to get into it

 * On the coastline next to beaches/the ocean and has great views

 * Made of mostly sustainable materials

 *  Not in a busy area and there is no obvious pollution.

Students may not like to because:

 * It is small

 * Is away from shops and towns

 * Appears lonely

 * Is on the coast so it is prone to erosion and other weather issues

 * Appears not well-insulated

Accept all sensible answers. 
Students now learn the difference between natural and processed materials, and
are provided with an opportunity to sort a range of materials into two different
groups.

As an extension activity, ask students to brainstorm other materials that would
fit into each group.

Answers

Natural: stone, wool, gold, wood

Processed: rubber, paper, plastic, glass
Students are explicitly taught what a material is, before being provided with an
opportunity to identify a range of materials used in a home.

Through the exploration of a virtual home, students play a game of Material I
Spy, identifying a range of materials found in the kitchen and living room. A
word bank supports students with their choice of materials.

To extend students further, introduce materials not found in the display home
such as paper, wax, bricks or porcelain. Have them share objects made from these
materials that they have seen in homes.
This creative-thinking activity requires students to focus on and summarise what
they have learnt about the properties of materials.

They write descriptions for glass and wood without using the words themselves,
but by using other closely associated words (like the game Taboo).
