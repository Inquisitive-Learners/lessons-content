**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 5917

**Lesson name:** Volcano Power!

**Lesson duration:** 100 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Do volcanoes create or destroy?

**Focus question image:**
Volcanic landscape at sunrise with steam rising, mountains, and dramatic clouds.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students investigate how volcanic activity can create or destroy landscapes, building their understanding of how natural forces shape the Earth’s surface. They explore volcanic effects through a modelling activity, an eBook and a sorting interactive. Students demonstrate their understanding by completing a checkpoint activity, identifying how eruptions change landscapes and explaining the knock-on effects using causal connectives. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use compound and complex sentences to sequence connected ideas into paragraphs when explaining cause and effect The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN2-CWT-02

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question, 'Do volcanoes create or destroy?'
Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Describe how volcanic eruptions change the landscape.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify what happens during a volcanic eruption.
- Model the effect of a volcanic eruption on the landscape.
- Write sentences to describe the changes in landscape caused by volcanic
- eruptions and their knock-on effects.

**TEACHER READING:**
A volcano is an opening in the Earth’s crust through which molten rock, gases
and ash can escape. The molten rock below the ground is called magma, and once
it reaches the surface it becomes lava.

Most volcanoes form at the edges of tectonic plates, where plates either move
away from one another or collide. This movement allows magma to rise through
weak spots in the crust.

Volcanic eruptions can be destructive, burying landscapes and affecting
communities, but they can also be constructive by creating fertile soils and new
land.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Do volcanoes create or destroy?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of how volcanic eruptions change the landscape.

on the artefacts that were discovered and what they reveal about ancient Roman
life.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Pompeii was a busy city in the ancient Roman empire until Mount Vesuvius erupted
in 79 AD. In hours, its landscape was buried under ash and left undiscovered for
1500 years. When archaeologists rediscovered it, it showed them how people lived
and worked thousands of years ago.
