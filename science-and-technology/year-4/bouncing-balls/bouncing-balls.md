**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 692

**Lesson name:** Bouncing Balls

**Lesson duration:** 120 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Is it fantastic to be elastic?

**Focus question image:**
A colourful ball made of rubber bands, with loose bands on a wooden surface.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students are introduced to elastic materials. They identify whether familiar objects are made from an elastic material, using a flow chart to help them. They learn why elastic materials are often used by designers and manufacturers to make sports balls, and consider what would happen if certain balls were made from alternative materials. Students then conduct an experiment to investigate which sports ball has the highest elasticity (the one that is the bounciest. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Have students look at the image and discuss what they see. Then ask, 'Is it
fantastic to be elastic?' Prompt them to think of objects that have elasticity
and what the objects are used for. Document and use the students’ responses to
help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Learning Intention
- Students will be able to:
- Carry out, record and evaluate an experiment to find out which ball is the
- bounciest (has the highest elasticity).

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

Elasticity is the ability of an object to return to its original shape after
being subjected to a force (such as being stretched, pulled or squashed).
Elastic objects bounce back to their original shape very quickly. 

Elasticity is important for many things such as clothing, sports equipment, and
items that need to provide movement but keep things in place. As such, designing
items that serve these purposes requires materials with elasticity. 

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Is it fantastic to be elastic?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.
Additional information about tennis balls

Tennis balls are generally made from two pieces: an inner rubber core and an
outer felt cover. The cover is usually made from a type of felt called flannel,
which is a combination of wool and nylon fibres that are tightly woven together.
The rubber core is made from a combination of natural and synthetic rubber, and
is designed to give the ball a bouncy feel. The core also contains a pressurised
air or nitrogen to help the ball maintain its bounce.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to carry out, record and evaluate an experiment to find out which ball
has the highest elasticity.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
To engage students and provoke curiosity in the lesson, watch the video of a man
slacklining. Slacklining involves balancing and performing moves on a two to
five centimetre-wide piece of webbing made from synthetic fibres, which is
rigged between two fixed points, often trees.

It may be beneficial for students to watch the video more than once. The first
time for enjoyment, and the second time to complete the See, Think, Wonder
visible thinking activity. 
Students now conduct an experiment to find out which of three balls has the
highest elasticity.

Read the aim together and assist students to collect the materials needed.

Either as a class or in their small groups, students should read the steps of
the experiment carefully.

Once they have a clear understanding of what they need to do, ask students to
predict what they think will happen. Remind them that a prediction should be
based on their prior knowledge, experiences, observations and research.
Encourage students to use the word 'because' in their prediction to encourage
critical thinking, reasoning and understanding of scientific concepts.

As students complete the experiment they should record their results on the
recording sheet provided.

Students complete the experiment by reflecting on the accuracy of their
prediction and consider if there is anything they would change if they did the
experiment again. An opportunity to discuss the concept of fair testing is
provided as students consider why it was important to drop all the balls from
the same height and on the same surface.
This critical-thinking activity requires students to take on different
viewpoints as they consider the statement, ' All waistbands should stretch to
three times their size' from the point of view of a manufacturer and a consumer.
They finish the activity by sharing their own point of view on the topic.

Example Answers

Manufacturer: Manufacturers might say that making waistbands stretch to three
times their size ensures their clothes are consistent and last longer. They
might think this makes clothes fit better and feel more comfortable for people
of all sizes. Plus, they might think people want stretchy waistbands because
they're seen as more comfortable and flexible, according to what customers say
they want. Alternatively, manufacturers might not want them to stretch three
times the size as this will reduce their market and profits. More sizes and they
sell more clothes.

Consumers: Some people might not like waistbands that stretch too much because
they find them too loose and uncomfortable. They might worry that really
stretchy waistbands won't last as long and could lose their shape. Also, they
might think waistbands that stretch a lot can look funny or feel weird when they
bunch up. Others might say that not everyone likes the same kind of waistband,
and having different options is better for everyone.
Students are provided with a definition of elasticity, drawing on the video to
consolidate understanding.

As a class explore the flow chart, 'Is it elastic?' Model for the students how
to read the flowchart, showing how it can be used to determine if an object has
been made from elastic material.

To finish the activity, students use the interactive grouping activity to sort
the objects into made from an elastic material or not. If possible, have
real-world examples of the objects so students can physically feel them.

Answers:

Elastic: balloon, swimming costume, socks, hair ties

Not elastic: play dough, cup, paper, chair
Providing the context for the experiment to come, students now consider how
people use their knowledge of materials and their properties in their everyday
working lives. The scenario of designers using what they know about how
materials behave to design the best balls for different sports is presented.
Laying the foundations for investigating which ball has the highest elasticity,
students watch a video of a bouncing tennis ball. Using what they saw in the
video, students reason about whether the tennis ball is made from an elastic
material.

Once students have had an opportunity to share their reasoning, read together
the information that explains why a tennis ball is made using elastic material.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
This activity takes the learning further as students consider how we depend on
elasticity to complete some activities.

Example answers

Playing Elastics: Elasticity is important because it allows the elastic loop to
stretch and bounce back, making it safer and more comfortable to jump and move
within the loop.

Bouncing on a trampoline: Elasticity is important because the surface of the
trampoline is elastic, allowing it to stretch and recoil with each bounce.
Elasticity enables higher jumps making trampolining fun and exciting.

Bungee Jumping: Elasticity is important because the bungee cord stretches but
then rebounds ensuring the jumper's safety by preventing sudden stops during the
jump. It makes the jump exciting as it creates a sensation of free fall followed
by a rebounding effect.

Firing a slingshot: Elasticity is important because it determines the force with
which the projectile is launched. The elasticity of the rubber band allows for a
controlled and consistent release that helps with accuracy and effectiveness in
hitting targets.
