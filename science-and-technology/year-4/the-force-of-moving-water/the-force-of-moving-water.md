**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 5885

**Lesson name:** The Force of Moving Water 

**Lesson duration:** 100 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How does moving water affect Earth's surface?

**Focus question image:**
Aerial view of lush green wetlands with winding waterways and distant coastal waters.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore how the force of moving water changes Earth’s surface by shaping landforms through erosion. They investigate whether more erosion occurs when water flows down a steeper slope by carrying out an experiment. They analyse their results and draw conclusions to answer the scientific question. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question, 'How does moving water affect
Earth's surface?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Describe and model how the force produced by moving water causes erosion.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that erosion is the movement of rocks, soil and sand to another
- place.
- Set up an investigation to model how the force of moving water causes
- erosion.
- Carry out an investigation to model how the force of moving water causes
- erosion.
- Use results to describe how the force produced by moving water causes
- erosion.

**TEACHER READING:**
Erosion is a process that directly follows the process of weathering. In order
for students to build a fuller picture of how the surface of Earth changes, this
lesson should be presented after the Weathering Rocks lesson.

If we describe weathering as the breaking of rock on the surface of Earth,
erosion can be described as the taking of the broken rock fragments from one
place to another. (A third process, called deposition, describes the dropping or
settling of these fragments in a particular location.)

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How does moving water affect Earth's surface?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how the force produced by moving water causes erosion.

  Materials: Book, Plastic tray, Sand, Water, Devices (ipad or laptop)

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST2-PQU-01 (poses questions to create fair tests that investigate the effects of energy on living things and physical systems)
2. ST2-SCI-01 (uses information to investigate the solar system and the effects of energy on living, physical and geological systems)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students read the Dreaming story Super Snake. Before reading, you may wish to
prime students by telling them the questions you will be asking after they have
read the story:

 * What landforms did Super Snake create?

 * Why did he create them?

 * How did he create them?

You may need to remind students that a landform is a natural feature on the
Earth's surface.
[Plain Text] Read the Dreaming story Super Snake.
[Discussion] What landforms did Super Snake create? 
[e-book-interactive] Component with stimulus ID: 17797
[Discussion] Why did he create them? 
[Discussion] How did he create them? 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Read the purple box with the students, introducing the scientific perspective of
how landforms are created.

Students then explore the interactive, which visually demonstrates both
weathering and erosion. Encourage students to make careful observations about
what happens to the rocks in the different scenarios. 
PART 1:
[Statement Box] For more than 65 000 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have
been explaining the formation of landforms through Dreaming stories. A different
explanation is that natural forces, like wind and water, create landforms. 
[Discussion] What did you see happening? 
[Discussion] What do you think happened to the rocks that fell into the water?
[Plain Text] Tap on the wind and water buttons.

PART 2:
[Statement Box] The force of the wind and the water weathered and broke down the rocks that
formed the cliffs. A process called erosion then moved the weathered rock to a
new location.

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students read about wind and water as causes of erosion, and then complete the
Name, Describe, Act thinking routine with a classmate. Encourage them to note
how each process carries rocks, soil and sand, creating new landforms. Have them
act out and explain each cause of erosion, showing their deepened understanding
of these natural forces.

--Suggested lesson break--
[Plain Text] Read about two causes of erosion. 
[Plain Text] After reading, complete the Name, Describe, Act thinking routine with a
classmate. 
[Discussion] Name a cause of erosion. 
[Discussion] Describe it. 
[Discussion] Act it out.

[Image] Image split: waterfall on the left, eroded rock formation on the right with text about erosion. The text says: Erosion is the movement of rocks, soil and sand to another place. The force of wind and water are two causes of erosion. 
[Image] Image features an explanation of wind erosion alongside Pinnacles rock formations. The text says: Wind erosion happens in dry areas. Wind blows onto weakened soil and sand and carries the particles through the air. 

When the wind slows down or stops blowing, the soil and sand fall to the ground in new places. Overtime, new landforms are created. 

It is through that wind erosion played a part in the creation of The Pinnacles in Western Australia. 
[Image] Image depicting water erosion processes and the Twelve Apostles in Victoria. The text says: Flowing water picks up pieces of weathered rock, which includes sand, pebbles and soil. As the water runs, the sediment is carried through the water then deposited to create new landforms. 

It is thought that water erosion played a part in the creation of The Twelve Apostles in Victoria.

Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students are introduced to the scientific question, 'Does the force of water
cause more erosion when it flows down a steeper slope?' Students should work in
groups of three or four to carry out their investigation. If three trays are not
available for each group, ask students to use the same tray three times,
resetting the sand each time.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Work with a group to investigate the scientific question.
[Statement Box] Scientists ask questions. They then plan an investigation to find out the
answer. 
[Statement Box] Does the force of water cause more erosion when it flows down a steeper slope? 
[Plain Text] Materials 

Each group will need: 

 * 3 trays

 * 4 books or blocks

 * Damp sand

 * Container of water

 * Cup 

 * Device to record to a video 

 * Recording page from Activity 6
[Image] A collection of items: a cup, a sand pile, an iPad, a measuring jug, trays, and books.

PART 2:
[Instruction Box]  1. Place sand on one side of each tray.

 2. Use your finger to draw a wavy line in the sand, from top to bottom. This is
    your 'river'.

 3. Leave tray 1 flat on the table.

 4. Prop one end of tray 2 with one book or block to make a gentle slope.

 5. Prop one end of tray 3 with three books or blocks to make a steep slope.
[Plain Text] Set up your investigation.

[Image] A white tray filled with sand leans against stacked books next to a yellow cup. - [object Object]

PART 3:
[Instruction Box] Read through the steps to find out how to conduct your investigation. 
[Instruction Box] Steps

 1. Fill the cup with water. 

 2. Test tray 1 by pouring water at the top of the river. Take a slow-motion
    video and observe what happens. 

 3. Repeat step 2 with tray 2 and 3.

 4. Observe what has happened in each tray. Watch your slow-motion video. 

 5. Record your observations on the recording page in Activity 5.
[Image] A hand pours water from a yellow cup onto a tray of brown sugar.

PART 4:
[Discussion] What do you predict will happen to the sand in each tray? 
[Discussion] Do you think there will be a difference? Why or why not? 
[Instruction Box] Now you are ready to carry out the investigation. 
[Plain Text] Predictions and Fair Testing 
[Statement Box] Remember that for an investigation to be a fair test, we must only change one
thing. 
[Discussion] What are you changing in your investigation? 
[Discussion] What are you keeping the same? 
[Image] Three children look curious, pondering over a textured material on a white board.
[Discussion] What do you predict will happen to the water in each tray?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 25 minutes
Materials: Book, Plastic tray, Sand, Water, Devices (ipad or laptop)

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students should draw what they observed in each tray, clearly showing the path
of the water and the amount of sand at the bottom (and perhaps also on the
sides) of the tray. Prompt them to also note down any differences in the speed
of the water between the three trays. They may need to watch their slow-motion
video to see this.
[Instruction Box] Draw and label your observations for each tray.

 * Describe the speed of the water. 

 * Describe the amount of sand that has been dropped at the bottom of each tray.

 * Show what has happened to the 'river'.
[Instruction Box] Results 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students should use their observations to answer the following questions:

 * Which tray showed the most erosion? Why?

 * Which tray showed the least erosion? Why?

The key understanding here is that a steeper slope makes the water go faster.
The faster the water moves, the more force it has and therefore the more sand
that is moved.

Finally, students answer the scientific question, Does the force of water cause
more erosion when it flows down a steeper slope?
[Instruction Box] Explain your results. 
[Coloured Box] Remember!

Erosion is the movement of rocks, soil and sand to another place.

Duration: 15 minutes
Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how the force produced by moving water causes erosion.

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Students take their learning further by planning their own investigation related
to erosion. They can choose either of the questions below or can form a question
of their own:

 * Do bigger waves cause more erosion?

 * Can wind speed affect erosion?
   
   

Students need to decide what materials they will need and what steps they will
follow to carry out the investigation. Remind them of the need for a fair test.
Which things will they keep the same? Which things will they change?

If investigating wind speed, a hair dryer or fan with different speed settings
is useful. If time and resources permit, students could carry out their planned
investigation and make observations to answer the question. 
[Plain Text] Plan your own erosion investigation. Choose one of the questions below or think
of your own. 
[Instruction Box] Do bigger waves cause more erosion?
[Coloured Box] Can wind speed affect erosion? 

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 20 minutes

**ACTIVITY 8:**
Description: Students learn how motorboats and jet skis affect erosion, consider different
perspectives, and suggest solutions that lessen the impact on shorelines.
[Statement Box] Motorboats and jet skis cause waves that erode the shoreline. The bigger the
waves, the greater the force and the more erosion that takes place. 
[Plain Text] Some people think a solution is to reduce the speed limit when motorboats and
jet skis are close to the shoreline as this would reduce the force of the
waves.  Consider this solution from three different perspectives. 

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 15 minutes
