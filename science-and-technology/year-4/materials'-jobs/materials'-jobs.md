**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 691

**Lesson name:** Materials’ Jobs

**Lesson duration:** 90 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Do materials have jobs?

**Focus question image:**
A child holds a blue plastic bottle planter filled with colourful flowers and greenery.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students learn that materials are chosen for specific purposes based on their properties. They learn how First Nations Peoples of Australia use their long-standing scientific knowledge of the properties of materials  to select and use natural materials available in their Country/Place for many different purposes. Addressing the issue of sustainability, students explore how materials can be repurposed once they are no longer needed and think deeply about why this is important.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Draw students' attention to the image and discuss what they see. Ask them if
they have ever made something like this. Do they think it is a good idea? Why?
Why not? Read the focus question, 'Do materials have jobs?' Document and use the
students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Understand that properties of materials influence their use.

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

Natural Materials

Natural materials are materials that come from plants, animals and rocks, or are
found naturally and can be used by us/humans to make things. Some examples are
wood, to build shelters; clay, which can be made into pots, cups and bowls; and
wool, which can be spun and knitted into jumpers. Natural resources in the earth
also contribute to materials and objects all around us.

Processed Materials

Processed materials are materials obtained through chemical processes. Often,
natural materials contribute to the manufacturing of processed materials. Glass
is made from sand developed from a range of processes. Other examples are
aluminium, steel, paper etc.

Composite Materials

A composite material is a combination of two materials with different physical
and chemical properties. When they are combined, they create a material that is
specialised to do a certain job, for instance, to become stronger, lighter, or
resistant to electricity. Some examples are concrete, fibreglass and asphalt.

Properties

Properties of a material generally refers to the features we can sense, measure
or test. For example, copper is cold, hard and can, depending on its form, have
some movement or malleability. In testing it, we would find that it can conduct
heat. In fact, it is ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical
conductivity.

The properties of a material influence its use.

Examples:

 * To produce heat, we use materials that conduct heat.

 * To stop something from getting wet, we would use a waterproof/water-resistant
   material.

 * To reduce carrying many objects, we may create a vessel such as a basket to
   carry items more easily and use materials at-hand to make it (weave basket
   from palm fronds).

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Do materials have jobs?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding that properties of materials influence their use.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students complete the 3Y’s thinking routine to explain why repurposing materials
is important. In this routine, students begin by considering personal reasons,
before moving on to local and global reasons. 

Example answers

Why might repurposing be important to me?

Students may cover several areas in their answers, including
recycling/environmental benefits, showing creativity/inventiveness, being
resourceful and saving money.

Why might repurposing be important to the people around me?

In this response, some of the answers not covered as personal reasons above may
feature. Students may also draw on the Aboriginal items to indicate that
repurposing can be used to share culture.

Why might repurposing be important to the world?

The most common responses will be to save money and to save the environment.
Some students may discuss the profits to be made in repurposing, up-cycling and
environmentally positive manufacturing.
Designed to provoke thinking about how the properties of materials influence
their uses, students observe the image of a teapot made from an unusual
material. TheyThink, Pair, Share what sort of material they think the teapot is
made from, before watching a video that reveals that the teapot is in fact made
from chocolate.

After watching the video, students complete a Plus, Minus, Interesting thinking
activity about the chocolate teapot. Students should be encouraged to provide
science-based and material property responses, and include any questions they
may have at the bottom of the page or in the Interesting column.

Example answers

Plus

 * Chocolate is delicious

 * Has the form of a teapot

 * Is novel/creative

 * If you only put boiling water in it and placed it in a big bowl, you’d have a
   big bowl of melted chocolate 

 * Melted chocolate mixes with the tea, making chocolate tea

 * You can eat it after you drink your chocolate tea

Minus

 * Boiling water melts the teapot and its function is to hold/brew tea

 * Leaks upon melting

 * Melted chocolate mixes with the tea, ruining the tea

 * As the handle melts, you cannot pour, making it messy for your hands and
   unusable

 * When heat is applied to solids such as chocolate, it melts, forming a liquid.
   As such, the design is flawed as it did not account for the phase transition
   from solid to liquid

Interesting

 * Perhaps there is a way to improve the design?

 * If you made the tea quickly under a minute, would it be regular tea?
This activity provides an opportunity to explicitly teach the key understanding
that the properties of a material influence its uses.

After sharing the information about clay being a good material for making
teapots, have a class chat about why rubber is a good material for making
gumboots. You may which to discuss that some gumboots are made from a processed
material like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as
they are a cheaper alternative to rubber but have almost the same properties.

Example answer

Rubber is a good material for making gumboots because it is flexible,
waterproof, durable and offers good grip.

Students then independently explore four other products, identifying the
material each product is made from and why they think that material has been
chosen.

Example answer

Window pane - made from glass. Glass is transparent so it lets light in. It is
weather resistant and provides thermal and sound insulation. It can be cut to
fit any shape and is easily cleaned.

Walls of this house - made from stone. Stone is strong and lasts a long time. It
can support a lot of weight and provides sound insulation. Stone is also
sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Towel - typically made from cotton but could be microfibre, bamboo or linen.
These materials are absorbent, soft and durable. They are all breathable
fabrics, so they dry quickly.

Drink bottle - made from plastic. Plastic is lightweight and durable. It is
transparent which allows users to easily see the content of the bottle, and can
also be squeezed which is convenient for dispensing the liquid.
Addressing the cross-curriculum priority, 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Histories and Cultures', students read an eBook, Using Materials, to explicitly
learn how First Nations Peoples skilfully utilise materials from their local
environment to create a variety of essential products. Depending on the
students' reading level, the book can be read together as a class, in pairs or
independently.

Students are then provided with an opportunity to connect their learning to the
real world as they explore the 'Tjanpi Desert Weavers' website. It is suggested
this is completed as a whole-class activity. If being completed independently,
remind students of the importance of using websites safely.

Students should read the information about the materials used to make the
products (found in the About Us, Our Materials section, before exploring the
shop to find products made using tjanpi (sculptures and baskets) and ininti
seeds, Tatu and Nyitu (jewellery). They draw and describe their chosen products.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
Addressing the cross-curriculum priority, 'Sustainability', students are
introduced to the concept of repurposing. The process of repurposing involves
using a product to serve another purpose. Students look at three different
images where products have undergone repurposing. They are asked to identify the
main material used in the product, what its old purpose was, what its new
purpose is, and what properties make it suitable for this.

Answer

Glass bottle - made from glass. Old purpose was to hold water, new purpose is a
photo frame. Suitable for this purpose as glass is transparent allowing the
photo to be seen.

Tyres - made from rubber. Old purpose were wheels on a car, new purpose used as
sinks. Suitable for this purpose as rubber is durable, strong and waterproof.

Denim - made from denim material. Old purpose was a pair of jeans, new purpose
used as a pillow cover. Suitable for this purpose as denim is resistant to wear
and tear, and is soft and lightweight.
Students now have an opportunity to choose a product and think of a way they
could repurpose it. Begin by providing time for students to Think, Pair, Share
their ideas, before they draw a labelled diagram representing their repurposed
product. Students should also record how the material is suitable for its new
purpose.

Once all students have completed their design, use the TAG feedback routine to
engage the students in peer-assessment.

T – Tell your partner something you like about their design. 

A – Ask your partner something about their design. 

G –Give your partner a suggestion to make their design better.
This activity takes the learning further as students learn what a composite
material is and then research a common composite material—concrete.

After reading the information on the website, students then complete the
creative task of designing an advertisement to persuade someone of the value of
concrete. Different modes of presentation are listed for the students to choose
from, along with a checklist of features there advertisement could include.
This creative-thinking task requires students to consider some sayings that play
on the idea of products being made from materials not fit for purpose. They then
have an opportunity to apply what they have learnt in the lesson to create two
other examples where products are made from materials that are not fit for
purpose to turn into sayings.
