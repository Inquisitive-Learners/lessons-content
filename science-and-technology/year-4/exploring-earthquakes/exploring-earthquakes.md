**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 5887

**Lesson name:** Exploring Earthquakes

**Lesson duration:** 100 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What might cause Earth's surface to change quickly?

**Focus question image:**
A road damaged by an earthquake, exposing deep cracks and uneven surfaces.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students investigate how the sudden force of an earthquake can change Earth’s surface. They learn how an earthquake happens and create a model using Mars bars to demonstrate this. Students then dive deeper into the effect of earthquakes on the landscape, looking specifically at Japan’s Noto Peninsula earthquake in 2024. They demonstrate their understanding by writing sentences to explain the effect of the earthquake using the conjunction 'so'.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use compound and complex sentences to sequence connected ideas into paragraphs when explaining cause and effect The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN2-CWT-02

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question, 'What might cause Earth’s surface
to change quickly?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Describe how earthquakes can change the landscape.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that the movement of tectonic plates causes earthquakes.
- Model what happens to the land during an earthquake.
- Use a casual connective to help describe the effect of an earthquake on the
- landscape.

**TEACHER READING:**
Earth’s crust is divided into giant, interacting slabs of rock called tectonic
plates. These plates are in constant motion, driven by forces beneath Earth’s
surface.

Earthquakes happen when tension along plate boundaries or faults is released in
a sudden movement. This release sends shock waves through Earth’s crust, causing
the ground to shake.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What might cause Earth's surface to change quickly?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how earthquakes change the landscape.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Ipad, Knife - plastic, Mini chocolate bar

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students model how tectonic plates meet by gently pushing the halves of a mini
Mars bar (or similar chocolate bar) together to observe what happens to the
Earth's crust.

Place students in pairs and assist them to collect the materials they need.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Model how tectonic plates meet and earthquakes happen. Collect your materials
and read the steps on the next page. 
[Statement Box] Scientists create models to demonstrate real-world scientific phenomena. 
[Instruction Box] Materials 

Each pair will need:

 * 1 mini Mars bar

 * Serrated knife 

 * iPad (or a device that can take a slow-motion video)

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] Steps

 1. Cut a Mars bar in half. The Mars bar represents the Earth. 
[Discussion] What do you predict will happen when the two tectonic plates meet? 
[Instruction Box]  2. Observe what happens to the Earth's crust (the solid top layer of the Mars
    bar) when you push the two pieces towards each other.

PART 2:
[Plain Text] When the epicentre of an earthquake is in the ocean, it can cause a tsunami. A
tsunami is a series of large, powerful ocean waves. These waves are different
from the everyday waves we see at the beach. 
[Plain Text] Read the article to see the extent of the damage caused by the Tohoku earthquake
and tsunami in 2011.

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 20 minutes

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Students consider the Australian government’s decision to provide 10 million
dollars in emergency assistance to Samoa after a 2009 earthquake and tsunami.

They decide whether they think this was the right thing to do and why,
explaining their thinking. They are then asked to consider the reasons someone
might give for having the opposite opinion to them.
[Plain Text] In 2009, a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Pacific island nation of
Samoa, killing over 180 people and destroying landscapes including buildings,
roads, beaches and forests. In response, the Australian government gave $10
million in emergency assistance, which included support for rebuilding the
landscape.
