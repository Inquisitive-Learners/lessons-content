Lesson duration: 100 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: What might cause Earth's surface to change quickly?

Focus question image: A road damaged by an earthquake, exposing deep cracks and uneven surfaces.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students investigate how the sudden force of an earthquake can change Earth’s surface. They learn how an earthquake happens and create a model using Mars bars to demonstrate this. Students then dive deeper into the effect of earthquakes on the landscape, looking specifically at Japan’s Noto Peninsula earthquake in 2024. They demonstrate their understanding by writing sentences to explain the effect of the earthquake using the conjunction 'so'.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use compound and complex sentences to sequence connected ideas into paragraphs when explaining cause and effect The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN2-CWT-02

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the question, 'What might cause Earth’s surface
to change quickly?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Describe how earthquakes can change the landscape.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that the movement of tectonic plates causes earthquakes.
- Model what happens to the land during an earthquake.
- Use a casual connective to help describe the effect of an earthquake on the
- landscape.

TEACHER READING:
Earth’s crust is divided into giant, interacting slabs of rock called tectonic
plates. These plates are in constant motion, driven by forces beneath Earth’s
surface.

Earthquakes happen when tension along plate boundaries or faults is released in
a sudden movement. This release sends shock waves through Earth’s crust, causing
the ground to shake.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What might cause Earth's surface to change quickly?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how earthquakes change the landscape.

MATERIALS NEEDED:

  Materials: Ipad, Knife - plastic, Mini chocolate bar

  2. a landslide occured.
     (Table position: Row 3, Column 3)
  3. many buildings collapsed or were badly damaged.

Activity JeNKXPjpp66Q:
  1. Australia lies in the centre of a tectonic plate so it doesn't experience many
earthquakes.
  2. 
  3. 
  4. 

Activity 3X8okaXeVxoM:
  1. I see lots of dots flashing on a map of the world.
  2. Yes, they make me think that the video is highlighting earthquake locations.

Activity ubTCNEB5ZRsT:
  1. I predict the chocolate bar’s top layer will crack or buckle.
  2. The tectonic plates met so Earth's crust cracked in the middle/lifted up.

Activity CrU07maUiBc7:
  1. 

Activity cSKhWFYhspgn:
  1. • They are probably showing the location of earthquakes over time. • Each flash
might be an earthquake happening in a specific place.
  2. I think they were showing something happening in the oceans.

The correct answer is that they show where tsunamis occurred.
  3. • The powerful waves washed away buildings and roads near the coast. • Debris
covered the land, and beaches were eroded. • Low-lying forests and farmland were
flooded with salt water.
  4. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami changed the landscape in several ways. It
flooded the streets so many people had to evacuate using boats. It also ripped
down trees, houses and caused a huge amount of debris and rubble.

Activity uDnkNkmGVXmf:
  1. • Yes, because Samoa needed help recovering from the disaster. • Rebuilding
roads and homes helped people feel safe again and get back to their normal
lives.
  2. Yes, I think it was the right thing to do because people in Samoa needed help.
Their homes and towns were destroyed, and they would have been very sad and
scared. Giving money helped them rebuild and feel safe again. It’s kind to help
others when something bad happens.
  3. • They might argue that the money could be spent elsewhere. • They might feel
local governments should manage their own rebuilding efforts without outside
help.
  4. Someone might say Australia should spend the money on problems here instead,
like improving transport and hospitals. They might think we should only help our
own country first.

Activity h8jByRpxtGzQ:
  1. Roads, buildings, hills, rivers and coastlines.
  2. I think the worst change was the buildings collapsing because people could be
hurt or left without homes.
  3.  * Buildings collapsed, leaving rubble across roads

 * Landslides happened, changing the shape of hills and mountains 

 * River banks collapsed 

 * Deep cracks appeared in the road
  4. buildings collapsed, leaving rubble across roads.
