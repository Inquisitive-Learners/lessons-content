**Year:** Year 4

**Lesson ID:** 5886

**Lesson name:** Layers of the Earth

**Lesson duration:** 90 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What is beneath Earth's surface?

**Focus question image:**
A vibrant view of Earth from space, showcasing its blue oceans and green landmasses.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students are introduced to the layers of the Earth. They explore models and participate in collaborative discussions to build a shared understanding of each layer, specifically its temperature, thickness and what the layer is made from. Students demonstrate their understanding by creating and labelling a model of Earth’s layers. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary and noun groups to enhance the specificity of texts The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN2-VOCAB-01 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the question, 'What is beneath Earth’s surface?'
Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Describe and model the internal structure of the Earth.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Name each layer of the Earth.
- Construct a model of Earth's internal structure.
- Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary to describe the structure of Earth.

**TEACHER READING:**
The Earth is made up of four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core and
inner core. The crust is the outermost layer, composed mostly of rock and soil,
and is thicker under continents than under oceans. It’s where landforms, oceans
and human-made structures are found.

Beneath the crust lies the mantle, a thick layer of semi-solid rock that becomes
hotter with depth and moves very slowly. These slow-moving currents in the
mantle can drive surface changes like volcanic eruptions.

Below the mantle is the outer core, a hot, liquid layer made primarily of molten
iron and nickel.

At the very centre of the Earth is the inner core, also composed of iron and
nickel, but remaining solid due to immense pressure, despite being as hot as the
surface of the Sun.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What's beneath Earth's surface?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe and model the internal structure of the Earth.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Ball of play dough, Toothpick, Sticky label, Knife - plastic

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST2-SCI-01 (uses information to investigate the solar system and the effects of energy on living, physical and geological systems)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students watch video. You may like to play the video twice—the first time for
enjoyment and the second time so that students can consider the following
questions:

 * What did Scrat do to make the land crack?

 * Do you think this would happen in real life?

 * What do you think will happen next?
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Watch the video.
[Discussion] What did Scrat do to make the land crack? 
[Discussion] What do you think will happen next? 
[Discussion] Do you think this would happen in real life?
[Video] Scrat's Continental Crack-Up (short version)

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Explain that in the video Scrat fell through Earth's surface. Ensure that
students understand that Earth's surface is all the natural features on top of
our planet. As a class or on individual devices, check students' understanding
of Earth's surface by having them complete the interactive.
[Statement Box] In the video, Earth’s surface cracked, causing Scrat to fall through the layers
of the Earth. The Earth's surface is all the natural features on the top of our
planet, including land, water and the ocean floor.

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: This activity allows students to explore the different layers of Earth,
specifically the crust, mantle, outer and inner core. To draw students'
attention to the differing sizes and temperatures of each layer, pose the
following questions:

 * Why do you think the inner core is red in the model?

 * Which layer do you think it took Scrat the shortest time to fall through?
   Why?
[Statement Box] Earth's surface is the top part of Earth's crust. This is the outer layer of
Earth. 
[Plain Text] Explore the model to find out more about Earth's layers. 
[Discussion] Why do you think the inner core is red in the model? 
[Discussion] Which layer do you think it took Scrat the shortest time to fall through? Why? 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: This activity is an opportunity for students to make their own model of Earth's
layers.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] With a classmate, make your own model of Earth's layers.
[Instruction Box] Materials 

Each pair will need: 

 * 4 clearly different-coloured pieces of playdough

 * 4 toothpicks

 * 4 sticky labels or notes

 * 1 disposable knife

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] Build your Earth

 1. Roll a small ball of playdough (about the size of a grape). This is the
    inner core. 
    
    

 2. Flatten out a slightly bigger piece of playdough and wrap it around the
    inner core. This is the outer core. 

 3. Flatten out an even bigger piece of playdough and wrap it around the outer
    core. This is the mantle. 

 4. Flatten out the fourth piece of playdough until it is really thin. Wrap it
    around the mantle. This is the crust. 
[Instruction Box] Steps 
[Instruction Box] Reveal and label the layers

 1. Cut your model in half. 

 2.  Stick a toothpick in each layer.

 3. Write a label of each layer. 

 4. Attach the correct label to each toothpick.
