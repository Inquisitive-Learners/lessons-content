Unit Name: TEST local Forces Shape Earth's Surface
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore the processes that shape Earth’s surface. By examining natural forces such as earthquakes, volcanoes, weathering and erosion, students gain a deep understanding of how landscapes form, change and evolve. The unit integrates hands-on investigations, models and scientific reasoning to help students explain both sudden and gradual changes to Earth’s surface. Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete.

Lesson name: Layers of the Earth
Lesson duration: 90 minutes.

FOCUS QUESTION: What is beneath Earth's surface?

Focus question image: A vibrant view of Earth from space, showcasing its blue oceans and green landmasses.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students are introduced to the layers of the Earth. They explore models and participate in collaborative discussions to build a shared understanding of each layer, specifically its temperature, thickness and what the layer is made from. Students demonstrate their understanding by creating and labelling a model of Earth’s layers. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary and noun groups to enhance the specificity of texts The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN2-VOCAB-01 

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the question, 'What is beneath Earth’s surface?'
Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Describe and model the internal structure of the Earth.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Name each layer of the Earth.
- Construct a model of Earth's internal structure.
- Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary to describe the structure of Earth.

TEACHER READING:
The Earth is made up of four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core and
inner core. The crust is the outermost layer, composed mostly of rock and soil,
and is thicker under continents than under oceans. It’s where landforms, oceans
and human-made structures are found.

Beneath the crust lies the mantle, a thick layer of semi-solid rock that becomes
hotter with depth and moves very slowly. These slow-moving currents in the
mantle can drive surface changes like volcanic eruptions.

Below the mantle is the outer core, a hot, liquid layer made primarily of molten
iron and nickel.

At the very centre of the Earth is the inner core, also composed of iron and
nickel, but remaining solid due to immense pressure, despite being as hot as the
surface of the Sun.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What's beneath Earth's surface?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe and model the internal structure of the Earth.

MATERIALS NEEDED:

  Materials: Ball of play dough, Toothpick, Sticky label, Knife - plastic

LESSON OUTCOMES:
NSW Syllabus:
1. ST2-SCI-01 (uses information to investigate the solar system and the effects of energy on living, physical and geological systems)

SUGGESTED ANSWERS:
Activity 7ZYAtiQq27i0:
  1. Scrat hit the ground with his acorn so forcefully that it caused a huge crack to
appear in the mountain.
  2. No, it is unlikely. A single small action would not usually make the Earth’s
surface split so dramatically.
  3. I think the crack might grow bigger, splitting the ground even more.
  4. Scrat fell through a large crack on the Earth’s surface, plunging down into the
layers beneath it.

Activity w6LkDdYmixBM:
  1. 

Activity dLo57TPfV9JR:
  1. It is shown in red because it is the hottest layer and red usually represents
something very hot.
  2. It probably took him the shortest time to fall through the crust because it is
the thinnest layer of the Earth.

Activity YvwUyCwFkr1L:
  1. I found out that both the inner and outer core are made of metal. However, the
outer core is liquid metal and the inner core is solid metal.
  2. 1. It is the layer where we live.

2. It is the thickest layer.

Activity 7QqBFD74nsGS:
  1. I’d need to know how hot and each layer is and what kind of protective gear or
vehicle I’d need to survive those conditions.
  2. I’m excited about the chance to see layers of the planet that no one else has
seen and to discover any new materials or creatures that might exist
underground.
  3. I’m worried about the extremely high temperatures, the possibility of equipment
failure and not being able to return safely once I go too far down.
  4. We should develop special vehicles and protective suits that can handle high
heat, train thoroughly for emergencies and create a detailed rescue plan.
