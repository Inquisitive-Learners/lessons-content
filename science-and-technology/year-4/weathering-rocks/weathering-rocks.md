**Lesson ID:** 5884

**Lesson name:** Weathering Rocks

**Lesson duration:** 100 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How might Earth's surface change slowly?

**Focus question image:**
Starlit sky above rock formations in a sandy landscape.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students investigate how Earth's surface changes slowly over time by examining the process of weathering. Students explore the natural forces of water, wind and plants through hands-on activities, discovering how these agents gradually break down rocks. They demonstrate their understanding by describing these processes in a checkpoint activity, using causal language to explain each one.  
 This lesson supports the following Stage 2 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use compound and complex sentences to sequence connected ideas into paragraphs when explaining cause and effect The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN2-CWT-02

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the picture and ask them to describe what they see. Some students
may recognise this as the Three Sisters in the Blue Mountains. Read the focus
question, 'How might Earth's surface change slowly?' Document and use the
students’ responses to the question to help gauge their current understanding of
the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Explain how the forces produced by wind, water and plants weather rocks.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that rocks become weathered over time.
- Name three ways that rocks can become weathered.
- Write a paragraph to explain how wind, water and living things weather rocks.

**TEACHER READING:**
The word 'weathering' does not describe atmospheric weather conditions. It is a
specific term used to describe all the different ways that rocks on the surface
of Earth are broken down by ice, water, wind, temperature changes, plants and
animals. These are called the 'agents of weathering'.

Weathering, along with erosion, are two processes that shape the Earth's
surface. While they work together they are distinct processes: weathering
changes the rock's structure, while erosion moves the broken pieces,
redistributing them across the landscape.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How might Earth's surface change slowly?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of weathering.
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to explain how the force produced by wind, water and plants weathers
rocks.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Use the statement box to introduce the concept of weathering. Distribute a rock
to each student and ask them to examine it closely, noting things like colour,
texture and hardness. Use the questions on the page to support the exploration.
Have some volunteers share their rocks and their answers in a class discussion
after the partner conversations.
Reiterate to students that the cubes/rocks knocking together caused them to
weather, before introducing the interactive. This interactive explains the four
key agents of weathering: extreme temperature cycles, moving water, wind and
plants. Students can explore the interactive individually or with a partner if
devices are limited. Alternatively, it can be introduced as a teacher-led,
whole-class activity. After completing the interactive, use the multiple-choice
question to gauge student understanding of weathering.

Part 2 of 2:

After exploring the interactive, students use what they have learnt to complete
the flow chart.
Have students read the statement box which explains that natural forces can
cause fascinating landforms. Then direct students to use the provided links to
research the Giant's Causeway and Wave Rock. Students then complete a Venn
diagram to compare the Giant's Causeway and Wave Rock and their reasons for
weathering.
Explain that geologists refer to water, ice, wind and plants as the

agents of weathering. Have students apply their creative thinking to create a
superhero character for a combination of two of the agents. Then have them
explain the combined powers of their superhero and how it is able to change the
rocks on Earth’s surface.
To introduce weathering to students in an engaging and relatable way, have them
use the slider to view the ageing process and discuss the questions on the page.
Explain that rocks become weathered over time, just like the man's face in the
sliding visual. Introduce the scientific investigation which requires students
to explore weathering by placing some sugar cubes or soft rocks into a
container, putting on the lid and shaking it. Assist students to collect the
materials listed.

Part 2 of 3

Students read the procedure either independently or as a class. Once students
understand what they need to do, use the Think, Pair, Share thinking strategy to
support students in predicting what will happen to the cubes/rocks. Students
then carry out the investigation.

Part 3 of 3

Have students observe and draw the cubes/rocks prior to placing them into the
container and then again after they have been shaken. Ask students to record
what they think caused the cubes/rocks to change. Explain that even though the
cubes/rocks started to break up in only a few seconds or minutes, this process
takes many, many years to occur in nature. 

**PRACTICAL TIPS:**
The teacher may wish to do this as a whole-class investigation.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Rocks

  Materials: Timer, Sugar cube, Container (small), Paper (black construction)

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST2-SCI-01 (uses information to investigate the solar system and the effects of energy on living, physical and geological systems)

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Use the purple box to introduce the concept of weathering. Distribute a rock to
each student and ask them to examine it closely, noting things like colour,
texture and hardness. Use the questions on the page to support the exploration.
Have some volunteers share their rocks and their answers in a class discussion
after the partner conversations.

Students may think that hard, non-living objects like rocks are fixed and do not
change. This is an opportunity to address this misconception.
[Statement Box] The image changed from a young boy to an old man. The skin covering his face had
changed over time. Age made his skin thinner and wrinkled, and the Sun's rays
caused his skin to darken and form spots. We can describe the old man's face as
looking weathered.
[Image] Creased elderly face.
[Plain Text] Hold a rock in your hands and describe its colour, texture and hardness to a
classmate.
[Discussion] Has your rock always looked like this?

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Reiterate to students that the cubes/rocks knocking together caused them to
weather, before introducing the interactive. This interactive explains the three
key agents of weathering: moving water, wind and plants. Students can explore
the interactive individually or with a partner if devices are limited.
Alternatively, it can be introduced as a teacher-led, whole-class activity.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] In the investigation the rocks knocked against each other, causing them to
weather. Weathering is the breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces. Unlike in
the investigation, weathering usually takes a very long time. 
[Plain Text] Use the interactive to find out other ways that rocks can weather.

PART 2:
[Plain Text] Reflect on what you read in the interactive by completing the Connect, Extend,
Challenge thinking routine.

Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: In this activity students are required to use the sentence level skills they
learnt in lessons 2 and 3 to write a paragraph to explain how wind, moving water
and plants weather rocks.

The paragraph about how moving water weathers rocks has been done for them. As a
class, read the model paragraph. On reading a second time, ask students to
highlight parts of the paragraph that address the different parts of the
checklist. For example, 'Rocks can become weathered due to the power of moving
water' is the topic sentence.

As well as the causal connectives 'so' and 'as a result' that were introduced in
lessons 2 and 3, this paragraph also uses 'due to'. Ask students to identify
this causal connective.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Your task is to complete the flow chart about weathering on the next page. The
section about how water weathers rocks has been done for you. Use the checklist
to make sure everything has been included. 
[Coloured Box] Rocks can become weathered due to the force of moving water. Flowing rivers,
ocean waves and heavy rain all carry bits of sand, soil and other small
particles. These particles hit against rocks again and again so the surface of
the rock begins to wear away. As a result, sharp rocks become smoother and
smaller over time. This process is one way that weathering happens.
[Multiple Choice]
  a) A topic sentence stating the main idea of the paragraph ✓
  b) At least two causal connectives. Remember, these tell us what happens as a result of something else
  c) A concluding sentence that restates the main idea of the paragraph

[Discussion] There is a causal connective in the paragraph that you haven't learnt about in
lessons 2 or 3. What is it?
[Image] A variety of stones and pebbles scattered among dried leaves.

PART 2:

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 25 minutes
Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to explain how the force produced by wind, water and plants weathers
rocks.

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Have students read the statement box, which explains that natural forces can
cause fascinating landforms. Then direct students to use the provided links to
research Karlu Karlu (Devils Marbles) and Wave Rock. Students then complete a
Venn diagram to compare Karlu Karlu (Devils Marbles) and Wave Rock and their
reasons for weathering.
[Statement Box] Natural forces can shape fascinating landforms. Karlu Karlu (Devils Marbles) and
Wave Rock are examples of this.
[link] Component with stimulus ID: 7141
[Plain Text] Research these landforms and their reasons for weathering.

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 30 minutes

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Explain that geologists refer to water, wind and plants as the

agents of weathering. Have students apply their creative thinking to create a
superhero character for a combination of two of the agents. Then have them
explain the combined powers of their superhero and how it is able to change the
rocks on Earth’s surface.
[Statement Box] Water, wind and plants all cause weathering. Geologists call these 'agents of
weathering'.
[Plain Text] Create a superhero character by combining two agents of weathering. Explain the
combined powers of your superhero and how it changes rocks on Earth's surface.
[Image] Animated characters: a blue smiling ice-cube with arms and legs, a tree wearing a cape, and a fluffy creature with arms and legs, representing wind.

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
