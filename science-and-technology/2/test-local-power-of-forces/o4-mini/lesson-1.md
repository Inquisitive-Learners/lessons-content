# Lesson: Forces

---

## Lesson Overview

**Focus Question:**  
**What makes things move?**

**Learning Intention:**  
Students are learning to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**Success Criteria:**  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary _push_, _pull_, _towards_ and _away from_ in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

**Teacher Reading (Teacher Knowledge):**  
> **Forces**  
> A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.  
>
> **Pushes and pulls**  
> A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.  
>
> **Direction of forces**  
> Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.  
>
> **Objects and movement**  
> Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

**Note (Vocabulary):**  
> **Vocabulary Words**  
> The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words (low-frequency, subject-specific). Instruction should focus on building content knowledge. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

**Introduction:**  
Show students the cover image (three children playing on grass: one pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it, a third sits inside) and ask the focus question:  
> **What makes things move?**  
Have students recall everyday examples (toys, vehicles). Document responses to gauge prior understanding and address misconceptions.

## 1. Engage (5 min)  
### Section 1: Watch *Sledding Teamwork*  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students use the word *force* here.  

- Instruction Box (centered, blue border):  
  *Watch the video **Sledding Teamwork** and then answer the questions.*  
- Video: *Sledding Teamwork*  

**Discussion Questions:**  
1. **How did they get the sled to move?**  
   - *Suggested answer:* “The woman pushed the boy from behind making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.”  
2. **Why is it called _Sledding Teamwork_?**  
   - *Suggested answer:* “They needed more than one person to make the sled move.”

## 2. Explore (5 min)  
### Section 2: Objects at Rest  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.  

- Statement Box (purple border):  
  *Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.*  

- Three videos displayed side-by-side:  
  1. **Rope**  
     - _Discussion: Why is the rope moving?_  
     - *Suggested answer:* “The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.”  
  2. **Bike**  
     - _Discussion: What is making the bike move?_  
     - *Suggested answer:* “The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.”  
  3. **Pram**  
     - _Discussion: What is making the pram move?_  
     - *Suggested answer:* “The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.”

## 3. Explore / Explain (5 min)  
### Section 3: Introducing Forces  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification. It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull.  

- Statement Box (purple border):  
  **Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.  

- Interactive Component (rive animation) showing:  
  1. Children tugging a rope.  
  2. Child riding a bike.  
  3. Woman pushing a pram.  

- Instruction Box:  
  *Decide if each force is a push or pull.*

## 4. Explain (10 min)  
### Section 4: Push vs Pull – Direction  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing causes movement away from us, while pulling causes movement towards us. They may act out the movements before completing the sentences.  

- Statement Box (purple border):  
  *When we push an object it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.*

### Section 4.1: Brainstorm (5 min)  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body, or something like a stick or a bat. They brainstorm everyday activities requiring a push, a pull or both.  

- Draw Activity:  
  *As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.*  
- Statement Box (blue border):  
  *To push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body, or with something like a stick or a bat.*

## 5. Explain (5 min)  
### Section 5: Arrows to Show Direction  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine pictures and decide if each one is a push or pull.  

- Statement Box (purple border):  
  *We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.*  

- Instruction Box:  
  *Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?*

## 7. Elaborate (15 min)  
### Section 7: Action Word Sorting  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students consider how many action words describe forces. They act out and sort verbs into push and pull.  

- Instruction (centered):  
  *Act out the words on the tiles then sort them into the correct group.*  

- Interactive Categorisation Tiles:  
  - shove, throw, press, close → **Push**  
  - stretch, tug, tow, drag → **Pull**  

- *Suggested Answer:*  
  - Push words: shove, press, throw, close.  
  - Pull words: tug, stretch, tow, drag.  

#### Section 7.1: Action Word Cards (Differentiation/Enrichment)  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students select four action words from the sorting activity and create cards showing how each word represents a push or pull.  

- Instruction Box (blue border):  
  1. Select four action words from the sorting activity.  
  2. Record the action.  
  3. Draw a picture showing the action.
