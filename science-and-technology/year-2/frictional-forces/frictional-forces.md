**Year:** Year 2

**Lesson ID:** 6282

**Lesson name:** Frictional Forces

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What slows an object down?

**Focus question image:**
A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy sitting inside on a carpeted floor.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore friction as a force that slows down the motion of an object. They investigate how different surfaces affect movement by planning and conducting a simple investigation, recording their observations on how friction influences motion. Through this investigation, students learn to describe surfaces as smooth or rough. To deepen their understanding, they draw and label arrows to represent the direction and strength (magnitude) of the forces involved. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What slows an object down?'
Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object
slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a
track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’
responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify
any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how
- this affects the motion of an object.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction
- on the motion of an object.
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough
- surfaces.
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and
- the opposing force of friction.
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

**TEACHER READING:**
Friction as a force

Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into
contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement,
causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions
between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

Surface texture and friction

All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called
microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these
irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have
more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces
generate less friction.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What slows an object down?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Cardboard (thick), Block, Sandpaper, Piece of bubble wrap, Piece of aluminium, Piece of felt fabric, Piece of Carpet, Piece of velcro, Piece of plastic wrap

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST1-PQU-01 (poses questions based on observations and information to investigate cause and effect)
2. ST1-SCI-01 (measures and describes changes in living things, materials, movement, Earth and the sky)
3. ST1-DAT-01 (collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring
three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top
of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why.
It may be beneficial to have sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap available
for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect
each block's movement. Encourage the use of words such as bumpy, lumpy, rough
and smooth.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Look at the three different surfaces on this ramp.
[Coloured Box] Think, Pair, Share.
[Discussion] Which block do you think will slide down the ramp first?

Explain your thinking.

PART 2:
[Plain Text] With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.
[Instruction Box] Materials

Each pair will need:

 * A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different
   materials

 * Three identical small block-shaped objects 
[Image] Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.
[Coloured Box] Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?

PART 3:
[Instruction Box] Steps

 1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.
[Plain Text]  2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, making sure
    they are lined up.
[Coloured Box] Predict

PART 4:
[Coloured Box] Observe
[Instruction Box]  3. Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it
    until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves. 

PART 5:
[Coloured Box] Explain
[Instruction Box]  4. Record your results. 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 20 minutes
Materials: Cardboard (thick), Block, Sandpaper, Piece of bubble wrap, Piece of aluminium, Piece of felt fabric, Piece of Carpet, Piece of velcro, Piece of plastic wrap

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students learn that friction is the force that slows down moving things and
keeps still things from moving. Read the eBook to explore the concept further,
encouraging students to think of examples where friction plays a role in
everyday life. Use this opportunity to link back to the investigation by asking:

 * Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?

 * When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Read the eBook to learn more.
[Statement Box] Friction is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things
from moving.

[Coloured Box] rough
[Coloured Box] bumpy
[Coloured Box] smooth
[Coloured Box] weak
[Coloured Box] strong

Duration: 10 minutes
Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction.

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force
that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not
a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two
surfaces move against each other.

Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work.
Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that
suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage
students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their
understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Friction always works in the opposite direction to the direction of the force
that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down. 
[Coloured Box] We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.
[Discussion] Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?
[Discussion] In which direction is friction working in?
[Discussion] In which direction is the box being pushed?

Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of how friction affects the motion of an object.

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed
for and what surfaces they are used on.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. The surface you
move on and the soles (bottoms) of your shoes are always touching and rubbing
together. The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.
