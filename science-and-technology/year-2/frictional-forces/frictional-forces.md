Unit Name: TEST local Power of Forces
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore how forces affect the movement, speed, direction and shape of objects. Through engaging, hands-on activities, they identify examples of pushes and pulls in everyday life, using arrows to show the direction of each force. Students investigate the effect of friction on motion, comparing how different surfaces and materials can slow down a moving object. They explore magnetism, learning that magnets attract certain materials and have two poles. Students take part in a hands-on challenge to discover how magnetic forces can act at a distance. The unit concludes with them designing and making their own spinning top to investigate how forces influence the movement of toys, including both modern toys and traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples toys. 
 Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete.

FOCUS QUESTION: What slows an object down?

Focus question image: A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy sitting inside on a carpeted floor.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students explore friction as a force that slows down the motion of an object. They investigate how different surfaces affect movement by planning and conducting a simple investigation, recording their observations on how friction influences motion. Through this investigation, students learn to describe surfaces as smooth or rough. To deepen their understanding, they draw and label arrows to represent the direction and strength (magnitude) of the forces involved. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What slows an object down?'
Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object
slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a
track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’
responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify
any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how
- this affects the motion of an object.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction
- on the motion of an object.
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough
- surfaces.
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and
- the opposing force of friction.
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

TEACHER READING:
Friction as a force

Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into
contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement,
causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions
between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

Surface texture and friction

All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called
microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these
irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have
more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces
generate less friction.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What slows an object down?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction.

SUGGESTED ANSWERS:
Activity 8WKVSDC2S50d:
  1. It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has
less bumps than the others and it is easier for the block to move over it.
  2. It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is
bumpy and will slow the block down.
  3. It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.
  4. The foil surface needed the lowest lift.
  5. Sandpaper needed the highest lift.
  6. It is the roughest material and slows the block down.

Activity HFbmNTJ8tH5F:
  1. Friction is usually a weaker force than the push force moving the box, so it
shows that friction tries to slow the box down but is not as strong as the push
of the man.
  2. Friction is working in the opposite direction to the direction the box is being
pushed.
  3. The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer green
movement arrow.

ACTIVITY 3:
Activity ID: HFbmNTJ8tH5F
Section ID: UYQVs5naAF8K
Description: Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force
that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not
a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two
surfaces move against each other.

Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work.
Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that
suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage
students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their
understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Friction always works in the opposite direction to the direction of the force
that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down. 
[Coloured Box] We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.
[Discussion] Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?
[Discussion] In which direction is friction working in?
[Discussion] In which direction is the box being pushed?

Checkpoint: This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
