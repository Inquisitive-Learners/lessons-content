**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students investigate how pushes and pulls can change an object’s shape, direction or speed. They explore these concepts by experimenting with everyday materials and engaging in hands-on tasks that allow them to observe and describe the effects of force on objects. The lesson concludes with students learning that a force can also stop an object from moving. To demonstrate their understanding, students record and illustrate how they can affect an object’s movement using pushes or pulls. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What can a push or a pull
do?' Encourage students to share personal experiences, such as playing with
balls, opening doors or using household objects to explore how pushes and pulls
cause things to move. Document students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.
- Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of
- forces on objects.

**TEACHER READING:**
Pushes and pulls

A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object
towards you.

Changing shapes

Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay,
changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object
flattens, stretches or twists.

Changing speed

Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or
pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

Changing direction and stopping

Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or
pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What can a push or a pull do?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, adding real-life examples to their knowledge
bank.

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch
a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a
different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the
bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push
makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move
more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using
different amounts of force.
[Statement Box] A push or a pull can change the speed of an object.

It can make it move faster or slower.
[Discussion] How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?
[Discussion] How did the batter change the speed of the balls?

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students learn that a push or a pull can change the direction of a moving
object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s
hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the
ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce
different results. They describe or demonstrate these possibilities to show
their understanding of how a force can control the direction of a moving object.
[Statement Box] A push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object.
[Discussion] In what direction did the ball move?

Description: Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the
provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion. They
apply this idea to understand how a ball or bike can be stopped, or how balloons
can be held in place to keep them from moving.
PART 1:
[Statement Box]  A push or a pull can make an object stop moving too.
[Discussion] How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push
or pull changes its position, direction and speed. Students refine their
thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner. Have them explain their
predictions to show their understanding.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How
much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.

**ACTIVITY 9:**
Description: Students consider how some objects need a push and a pull to work. They explore
opening and closing a window and colouring with a crayon, drawing pictures with
arrows to show the direction of force used in each example.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for
it to work.
