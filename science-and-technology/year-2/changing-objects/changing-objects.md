Topic Name: TEST local Investigating Changes.
Topic overview: In Stage 1, students cover the focus area Investigations of changes provide knowledge and understanding. The focus area has been broken down into eight Inquisitive units.  In Year 1, students cover the following units:  Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats (Coming in late 2025)  Body Sense Organs  (Coming in late 2025)  Light in Action (Coming in late 2025)  Planet Earth (Coming in late 2025)  In Year 2, students cover the following units:  Power of Forces  Changes Over Time (Coming in late 2025)  Sound Journey (Coming in late 2025)  Exploring the Sky (Coming in late 2025) .
--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Power of Forces
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore how forces affect the movement, speed, direction and shape of objects. Through engaging, hands-on activities, they identify examples of pushes and pulls in everyday life, using arrows to show the direction of each force. Students investigate the effect of friction on motion, comparing how different surfaces and materials can slow down a moving object. They explore magnetism, learning that magnets attract certain materials and have two poles. Students take part in a hands-on challenge to discover how magnetic forces can act at a distance. The unit concludes with them designing and making their own spinning top to investigate how forces influence the movement of toys, including both modern toys and traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples toys. 
 Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete.

FOCUS QUESTION: What can a push or a pull do?

Focus question image: Child in a cap aiming a wooden slingshot, squinting with focus against a blurred background.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students investigate how pushes and pulls can change an object’s shape, direction or speed. They explore these concepts by experimenting with everyday materials and engaging in hands-on tasks that allow them to observe and describe the effects of force on objects. The lesson concludes with students learning that a force can also stop an object from moving. To demonstrate their understanding, students record and illustrate how they can affect an object’s movement using pushes or pulls. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What can a push or a pull
do?' Encourage students to share personal experiences, such as playing with
balls, opening doors or using household objects to explore how pushes and pulls
cause things to move. Document students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.
- Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of
- forces on objects.

TEACHER READING:
Pushes and pulls

A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object
towards you.

Changing shapes

Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay,
changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object
flattens, stretches or twists.

Changing speed

Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or
pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

Changing direction and stopping

Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or
pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What can a push or a pull do?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, adding real-life examples to their knowledge
bank.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

  2.  * A push can flatten or stretch dough.

 * A pull can make it longer or thinner.
  3.  * The rolling pin is being pushed back and forth.

 * The dough is being pushed down and out by the weight of the rolling pin.

Activity CbPim460rqWw:
  1. One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and
went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.
  2. The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to
each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the
ball speeding across the field.

Activity HcmCzTXmSjsM:
  1. The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from
the goal.
  2. Yes, if the goalie kicked or pushed the ball from another angle it would travel
a different way, or if the goalie stopped it differently it might bounce off in
a new direction. The goalie could also have caught the ball to stop it from
moving completely.
  3. The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.

Activity JRcFgXzurioU:
  1.  * The girl is about to catch the ball by pushing against the direction it's
   moving in. This will cause the ball to stop.

 * To stop the bike, the rider pushes or pulls the brakes.

 * A child pulls the string down to stop the balloons from flying away.
  2. Push

 * Go-karts are stopped when the driver pushes the brake pedal.

 * The goalkeeper pushes the ball away.

 * The child on the slide uses her feet to push up to standing to stop herself
   from sliding off.

Pull

 * The barking dog is held still by pulling on its lead.

 * The kite is stopped from flying away by pulling the string.

 * The rope on the boat is pulled to control the sail’s movement.

Activity RZfBDMCAb5ey:
  1. One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer
balanced.
  2. The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope
to move in that direction.
  3. Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced
so the rope stayed in place.
  4. The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope
did not move.

ACTIVITY 4:
Activity ID: CbPim460rqWw
Section ID: fg0XVLgCySyg
Description: Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch
a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a
different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the
bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push
makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move
more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using
different amounts of force.
[Statement Box] A push or a pull can change the speed of an object.

It can make it move faster or slower.

hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the
ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce
different results. They describe or demonstrate these possibilities to show
their understanding of how a force can control the direction of a moving object.
[Statement Box] A push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object.
