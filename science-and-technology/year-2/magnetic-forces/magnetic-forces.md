**Year:** Year 2

**Lesson ID:** 6283

**Lesson name:** Magnetic Forces

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What force can push or pull an object without touching it?

**Focus question image:**
A smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students investigate how the force of magnetism affects different objects. The concept of magnetism is introduced through a hands-on object hunt, where students test various materials to observe which are attracted to a magnet. Through this activity, students draw their own conclusions about the types of materials magnets attract. They also learn that magnets have two poles, and explore what happens when the poles of two magnets are brought together. The lesson concludes with a scientific challenge in which students demonstrate that magnetic force can act at a distance and through non-magnetic materials. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What force can push or pull
an object without touching it?' Encourage students to share any experiences or
objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Document the
students' responses to help gauge their current understanding and identify any
misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel
- the poles of another magnet.
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

**TEACHER READING:**
Magnetic materials

Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or
cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

Poles

Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought
together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

Non-contact force

Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their
invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around
a surface from underneath with a magnet.

Common uses

Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they
provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different
contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and
holding objects in place.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What force can push or pull an object without touching it?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

students to notice similarities in how the toys function.
[Discussion] What do they have in common?
[Discussion] How do these toys work?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it.
They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in
a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to
predict which items will attract to the magnet.
PART 1:
[Instruction Box] Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.

[Statement Box] The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to
it.

PART 2:
[Discussion] What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?
[Discussion] What did the magnets attract?
[Discussion] Were there any objects that surprised you?
[Discussion] Did anything unusual happen with any objects?

[Plain Text] Discuss your object hunt with the class.
[Speech Bubble] I noticed that my magnet could attract more than one object at a time. 

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 10 minutes
Materials: Magnet

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north
pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles
together to observe if they pull or push each other.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] The ends of a magnet are called the north pole and the south pole.

They can attract (pull together) objects made of metal.

Magnets can also attract or repel (push away) the poles of another magnet.
[Plain Text] With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles
that are the same or different together.
[Image] Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.

Duration: 10 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip
around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their
reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength
needed to move something without touching it.
PART 1:
[Speech Bubble] I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet
touching it.
[Discussion] Do you think this is possible?
[Image] A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.
[Discussion] Explain your thinking.

[Instruction Box] Materials

 * A magnet

 * A metal paper clip

 * A paper plate

ability to identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.
Materials: Magnet, Paper clip, Disposable paper plate

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it.
They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track
without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the
magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast
and how their car moves.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work
together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and
the other set pulls the train along very fast.
[Image] A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.
[Coloured Box] Challenge

Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it. 
[Instruction Box] Materials

You will need:

 * A toy car

 * 2 magnets

 * Sticky tape

 * Road track
[Image] Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.

PART 2:

Differentiation: Blue Square - The blue square represents deeper learning activities. They take thinking to the next level and require more time, effort and sometimes research.
Duration: 20 minutes
Materials: Toy car, Bar magnet, Sticky tape, Cardboard (A3)

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets
were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy
expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their
trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.
[Statement Box] A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets
when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite.

The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet.

Many people thought that it had magic powers.
[Coloured Box] Try the trick on a classmate.

Differentiation: Black Diamond - The black diamond represents challenging activities. They require extended critical and creative thinking.
Duration: 20 minutes
