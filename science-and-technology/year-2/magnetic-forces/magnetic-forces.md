Topic Name: TEST local Investigating Changes.
Topic overview: In Stage 1, students cover the focus area Investigations of changes provide knowledge and understanding. The focus area has been broken down into eight Inquisitive units.  In Year 1, students cover the following units:  Collecting Scientific Data About Habitats (Coming in late 2025)  Body Sense Organs  (Coming in late 2025)  Light in Action (Coming in late 2025)  Planet Earth (Coming in late 2025)  In Year 2, students cover the following units:  Power of Forces  Changes Over Time (Coming in late 2025)  Sound Journey (Coming in late 2025)  Exploring the Sky (Coming in late 2025) .
--------------------------------
Unit Name: TEST local Power of Forces
Unit overview: In this unit, students explore how forces affect the movement, speed, direction and shape of objects. Through engaging, hands-on activities, they identify examples of pushes and pulls in everyday life, using arrows to show the direction of each force. Students investigate the effect of friction on motion, comparing how different surfaces and materials can slow down a moving object. They explore magnetism, learning that magnets attract certain materials and have two poles. Students take part in a hands-on challenge to discover how magnetic forces can act at a distance. The unit concludes with them designing and making their own spinning top to investigate how forces influence the movement of toys, including both modern toys and traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples toys. 
 Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete.

FOCUS QUESTION: What force can push or pull an object without touching it?

Focus question image: A smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear.

TEACHER READING NOTES:
In this lesson, students investigate how the force of magnetism affects different objects. The concept of magnetism is introduced through a hands-on object hunt, where students test various materials to observe which are attracted to a magnet. Through this activity, students draw their own conclusions about the types of materials magnets attract. They also learn that magnets have two poles, and explore what happens when the poles of two magnets are brought together. The lesson concludes with a scientific challenge in which students demonstrate that magnetic force can act at a distance and through non-magnetic materials. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What force can push or pull
an object without touching it?' Encourage students to share any experiences or
objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Document the
students' responses to help gauge their current understanding and identify any
misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel
- the poles of another magnet.
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

TEACHER READING:
Magnetic materials

Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or
cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

Poles

Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought
together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

Non-contact force

Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their
invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around
a surface from underneath with a magnet.

Common uses

Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they
provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different
contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and
holding objects in place.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What force can push or pull an object without touching it?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

ACTIVITY 3:
Activity ID: U3wEJoDUxbjS
Section ID: V814N2svNRqM
Description: Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north
pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles
together to observe if they pull or push each other.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] The ends of a magnet are called the north pole and the south pole.

They can attract (pull together) objects made of metal.

Magnets can also attract or repel (push away) the poles of another magnet.
[Plain Text] With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles
that are the same or different together.

ACTIVITY 5:
Activity ID: qdYuFLySYocc
Section ID: 8MGq7GU72SLA
Description: Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it.
They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track
without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the
magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast
and how their car moves.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work
together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and
the other set pulls the train along very fast.
[Image] A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.

ACTIVITY 6:
Activity ID: eYvB8NyeYneh
Section ID: U4ByHnVMxfoR
Description: Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets
were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy
expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their
trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.
[Statement Box] A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets
when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite.

The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet.

Many people thought that it had magic powers.
[Coloured Box] Try the trick on a classmate.

reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength
needed to move something without touching it.
