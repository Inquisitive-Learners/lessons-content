**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore and recognise how applied forces such as pushing, pulling and twisting play an important role in the movement of everyday toys and traditional toys used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Students demonstrate their learning by creating their own spinning top. They complete a flow chart and label the steps involved in making their spinning top, describing how the forces work together to make it move. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'How do toys work?'
Encourage students to share personal experiences with toys they use. Document
and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the
topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.
- Identify how spinning tops from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples
- are made and how they move.
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.
- Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a
- spinning top.

**TEACHER READING:**
Push and pull

Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion
or stop them from moving.

Twisting

A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin
a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the
same time, causing circular motion.

Cultural perspectives

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating
spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in
making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the
forces that affect everyday objects.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How do toys work?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys
move.

**EXPLANATIONS:**

Explain to students that many cultures make toys that use pushes and pulls. For
example, the First Nations Peoples of Australia and Torres Strait Islander
Peoples have a rich history of using spinning tops as both children's toys and
as part of a sporting game played by young men.

Have students explore the Australian Museum’s website to view what the First
Nations Australians' spinning tops toys looked like. Ask them to choose one of
the spinning tops and talk about how it was made, then draw what it looks like.

Part 2 of 2

Click on the picture to watch another type of spinning top in action. Discuss
why and how the the spinning top moved.
Students learn that a twist can be described as a combination of a push and a
pull. Ask the students to think of, and draw some other examples of things they
can twist.
Students now design their own spinning top. Remind them of the video they
watched, and explain how their design needs to show how a push or a pull makes
it move. Students consider how they could make their spinning top go faster,
before drawing and labelling what happened in the space provided.
This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their
understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’
attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that
Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a
rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis.
Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend
students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster. 
Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they
need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how
they made their spinning top move. 

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Cardboard, Sticks

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

NSW Syllabus:
1. ST1-SCI-01 (measures and describes changes in living things, materials, movement, Earth and the sky)
2. ST1-PQU-01 (poses questions based on observations and information to investigate cause and effect)
3. ST1-DAT-01 (collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed
and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling
create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have
students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push
and pull power the toy.
[Info] A kendama is a traditional Japanese toy.

It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.
[Info] Click on the kendama to watch the video.
[Discussion] Which part is pushed?
[Discussion] Which part is pulled?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and
how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to
the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out
using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.
[Info] When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.
[Info] When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They
participate in a Think, Pair, Share activity to identify other toys they know
that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing
and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and
pull forces acting on each toy.
