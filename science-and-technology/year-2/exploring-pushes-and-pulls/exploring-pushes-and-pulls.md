**Year:** Year 2

**Lesson ID:** 6280

**Lesson name:** Exploring Pushes and Pulls

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What makes things move?

**Focus question image:** Three children play on grass. One pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it from behind while another sits inside, smiling.
**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore how pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause movement by identifying the forces acting on everyday objects. They are introduced to these concepts through simple, hands-on experiences and investigations that prompt discussion about how forces can move objects either towards or away from them. To demonstrate their understanding, students label and illustrate the direction of these forces using arrows, showing how pushing or pulling can produce visible movement. 
 This lesson supports the following Stage 1 Creating written texts Science content point:  Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations Use simple and compound sentences, flow charts and labelled diagrams to describe a process or function 
 The lesson also supports the following English outcome:  EN1-CWT-01

LESSON INTRODUCTION:
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'What makes things move?'
Have them recall everyday examples of movement such as toys and vehicles,
helping them connect to their own experiences. Document and use students'
responses to gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

LEARNING INTENTIONS:
Students are learning to:
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an
- object, it moves towards us.
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.
- Use the vocabulary 'push', 'pull', 'towards' and 'away from' in compound
- sentences to describe forces.
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around
- the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

TEACHER READING:
Forces

A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction.
Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

Pushes and pulls

A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help
distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

Direction of forces

Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is
applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you
pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

Objects and movement

Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it
keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What makes things move?
   
   

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

NOTES:
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**
NSW Syllabus:
1. ST1-SCI-01 (measures and describes changes in living things, materials, movement, Earth and the sky)
2. ST1-PQU-01 (poses questions based on observations and information to investigate cause and effect)
3. ST1-DAT-01 (collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**
**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved,
introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students
understand or use the word 'force' here.
[Instruction Box] Watch the video Sledding Teamwork and then answer the questions. 
[Video] Sledding Teamwork
[Discussion] How did they get the sled to move?
[Discussion] Why is it called Sledding Teamwork?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at
rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three
videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is
set in motion.
[Statement Box] Things can’t move by themselves.

An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.
[Discussion] Why is the

rope moving?
[Discussion] What is making

the bike move?
[Discussion] What is making

the pram move?

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces
that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force
as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason
for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.

It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or
a pull. In this interactive activity, ‘push’ and ‘pull’ are introduced as nouns
as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as ‘Pull
the car seat belt’ they are used as verbs.
[Statement Box] Pushes and pulls are called forces. Forces make objects move.
[Interactive] Push or Pull?
[Instruction Box] Decide if each force is a push or a pull.

Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to
move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To
reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a
suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to
act out these movements, before using the provided words to complete the
sentences.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] When we push an object, it moves away from us.

When we pull an object, it moves towards us. 
[Image] A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.

[Instruction Box] Use the words to complete the sentences.
[Coloured Box] push
[Coloured Box] pull
[Coloured Box] away from
[Coloured Box] towards

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] To push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another
part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat.

PART 3:
[Instruction Box] Play Forces Charades as a class or in pairs. 
[Coloured Box] How to play:

 * Select an activity from the brainstorm list.

 * Act it out for a classmate to guess.

 * Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.
[Statement Box] I pull the rope so it moves towards me.
