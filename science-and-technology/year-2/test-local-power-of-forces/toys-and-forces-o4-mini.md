# Toys and Forces

**Lesson URL:** https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6284-toys-and-forces

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a **flow chart** to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.  

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.  

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image (father and son twisting spinning toys) and ask the focus question, **“How do toys work?”** Encourage students to share personal experiences with toys they use. Document and use their responses to gauge current understanding and identify any misconceptions.

## Focus Question  
**How do toys work?**

## 1. Engage: Kendama Push and Pull  
**Phase:** Engage • **Time:** 5 minutes  

**Activity Overview**  
- A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.  
- Click on the kendama to watch the video.  
- Students watch the video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage discussion of how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to the kendama’s function. Have students share what they noticed about how a push and a pull power the toy.

**Discussion Prompts**  
1. Which part is pushed?  
2. Which part is pulled?  

**Suggested Answers**  
- The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.  
- We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.

## 2. Explain: Push, Pull, and Spinning Tops  
**Phase:** Explain • **Time:** 15 minutes  

**Statement**  
Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.

**Activities**  
- **Think, Pair, Share:** What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?  
- **Drawing:** Draw each toy and use arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make it move.

**Teaching Notes**  
Explain that many cultures make toys using pushes and pulls. For example, First Nations Australians and Torres Strait Islander Peoples use spinning tops as both children’s toys and in sporting games. Have students explore the Australian Museum website to view these tops, choose one, discuss how it was made, then draw it.

### 2.1 Subsection: Spinning Top Video and Discussion  
**Phase:** Explain (continued)  

**Instruction**  
Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.

**Discussion Prompts**  
- Why is the spinning top moving?  
- How is it moving?  

**Suggested Answers**  
- “It's moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.”  
- “It is spinning around on its tip until it slows down and stops. It also propels forward slowly with the spinning force.”

### 2.2 Subsection: Cultural Perspectives and Inquiry  
**Phase:** Explain (continued)  

**Statement**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a rich history of making and using spinning tops.

**Discussion Prompts**  
1. Who used the spinning tops?  
2. What are they made from?  
3. How do they move?  
4. What did you find interesting?  

**Teaching Notes**  
Discuss the rich tradition of spinning tops among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.  
- **Who?** Children for fun; men in competitions.  
- **Materials?** Small gourds mounted on sticks, secured with fibre and resin; sometimes beeswax on a stick.  

**Extension**  
1. Click the link to visit the Australian Museum website.  
2. Explore spinning tops made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.  
3. Discuss the questions above.

## 3. Explore: Twisting Forces  
**Phase:** Explore • **Time:** 10 minutes  

**Statement**  
A **twist** is a push and a pull. You can twist a spinning top to make it move.

**Image**  
Hand using fingers to twist a spinning top, arrows showing that the spinning top will spin round.

**Activity**  
Draw and label some other things we can twist.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that a twist combines push and pull. Ask them to think of, and draw, examples of things they can twist.

**Suggested Answers**  
Students might draw:  
- A bottle with a twist-off lid and an arrow curving around the top.  
- A doorknob with a curved arrow showing how it turns.  
- A wind-up toy with a circular arrow at the key.

## 4. Elaborate: Design Your Own Spinning Top  
**Phase:** Elaborate • **Time:** 20 minutes • **Differentiation Level:** 2  

**Challenge**  
Design your own spinning top. How could you make it go faster?

**Activities**  
- **Design Sketch:** Draw design ideas in the thought bubble.  
- **Experiment Sketch:** Draw and label what happened when you tested it.

**Teaching Notes**  
Remind students of the video. Explain that their design must show how a push or pull makes the top move. Encourage them to consider size, shape or added weights to increase speed.

**Suggested Answer**  
_Example:_ “I designed a spinning top with a larger cardboard circle and a longer handle to spin it faster. I might add weights around the circle to keep it balanced.”

## 5. Elaborate: Totem Tennis Forces  
**Phase:** Elaborate • **Time:** 20 minutes • **Differentiation Level:** 3  

**Statement**  
Totem tennis is a game where you hit a ball attached to a pole by a rope.

**Activity**  
1. Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces in action.  
2. Describe how you can make the ball go faster.

**Teaching Notes**  
Use the image of a boy playing Totem Tennis. Ask students to think about the push from the paddle and the pull of the rope as they hit the ball around the pole. Extend by asking how to increase speed.

**Suggested Answers**  
- Students might draw the ball on a rope, with an arrow showing the push from the paddle and an arrow showing the pull around the pole.  
- “You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.”

## Conclusion  
Revisit the focus question **How do toys work?** Ask students to share their ideas and address any remaining misconceptions.
