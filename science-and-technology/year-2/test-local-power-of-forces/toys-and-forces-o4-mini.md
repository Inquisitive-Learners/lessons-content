*(Source: “Students are learning to: Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.”)*  

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

- Which part is pulled?  
You might have them act out the motions with an imaginary kendama.

### Sub-Activities  
1. **Which part is pushed?**  
   - Response: text/draw/upload  
   - **Teaching Notes:** Students explain how pushing the handle lifts the ball.  
   - **Suggested Answer:** “The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.”  

2. **Which part is pulled?**  
   - Response: text/draw/upload  
   - **Teaching Notes:** Students explain how pulling the handle helps catch the ball.  
   - **Suggested Answer:** “We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.”

### Section s → Subsection V: Another Spinning Top Video (Activity 2 a)  
**Component:** Video (stimulusId 19250)  

![Alt text not provided for video.]  

#### Instruction Box  
> Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.

### Discussion  
1. **Why is the spinning top moving?**  
   - Response: text/draw/upload  
   - **Suggested Answer:** “It’s moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.”

2. **How is it moving?**  
   - Response: text/draw/upload  
   - **Suggested Answer:** “It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It is also propelling forward slowly with the spinning force.”
