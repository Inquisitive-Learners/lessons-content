# Toys and Forces

**Lesson URL:** https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6284-toys-and-forces  
**Focus Question:** How do toys work?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a **flow chart** to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, **“How do toys work?”** Encourage students to share personal experiences with toys they use. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## 1. Kendama Exploration  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Engage & Explore**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

**Activity Flow**  
1. Introduce the kendama:  
   “A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.”  
2. Students click on the kendama image to watch the video.  
3. Discussion responses (text/draw/upload):  
   - **Which part is pushed?**  
     *Answer:* The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.  
   - **Which part is pulled?**  
     *Answer:* We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.

## 2. Push and Pull Actions  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Explain & Engage**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

**Activity Flow**  
- Present two statements side by side in columns:  
  1. **When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.**  
  2. **When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.**  
- Use the two animations to illustrate each action:  
  - **Push** animation (labels: Push / Ball goes up / Push stick)  
  - **Pull** animation (labels: Pull / Catch ball / Pull stick)  
- Students discuss or act out each action.

## 3. Exploring Push, Pull or Both  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Explain & Explore**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

### 3.1 Draw Examples  
- **Statement Box:** Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.  
- **Think, Pair, Share**: Students name toys that move by push, pull or both.  
- **Draw:** “Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.”  
  - *Example answers:*  
    - A small toy car on a flat surface with an arrow pointing forward from the back of the car.  
    - A toy animal with wheels and a string, with an arrow pointing from the toy toward the child’s hand.  
    - A yo-yo on a string going up and down with one arrow pointing down (push), one pointing up (pull).  
- **Discussion Prompt:** “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?”  
  - *(Open-ended responses)*  

### 3.2 Observing a Spinning Top in Action  
**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.

- **Instruction Box:** Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.  
- **Video of spinning top**  
- **Discussion responses:**  
  - **Why is the spinning top moving?**  
    *Answer:* It’s moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.  
  - **How is it moving?**  
    *Answer:* It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It is also propelling forward slowly with the spinning force.  

### 3.3 Cultural Context of Spinning Tops  
**Teaching Notes**  
Explain to students that many cultures make toys that use pushes and pulls. For example, the First Nations Peoples of Australia and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a rich history of using spinning tops as both children's toys and as part of a sporting game played by young men. Have students explore the Australian Museum’s website to view what the First Nations Australians' spinning tops looked like. Ask them to choose one of the spinning tops and talk about how it was made, then draw what it looks like. Part 2 of 2: Click on the picture to watch another type of spinning top in action. Discuss why and how the spinning top moved.

- **Statement Box:** Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a rich history of making and using spinning tops.  
- **Link to Australian Museum website**  
- **Discussion responses:**  
  - **Who used the spinning tops?**  
    *Answer:* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples used spinning tops. Children use them for fun and men use them for competitions.  
  - **What are they made from?**  
    *Answer:* They are made from small gourds which have been mounted on sticks and secured with fibre and resin. They are made from beeswax and attached to a thin stick of wood.  
  - **How do they move?**  
    *Answer:* They spin around when you twist or flick them.  
  - **What did you find interesting?**  
    *(Open-ended responses)*

## 4. Understanding Twists  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Explore**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that a twist can be described as a combination of a push and a pull. Ask the students to think of, and draw some other examples of things they can twist.

**Activity Flow**  
- Display an image of a hand twisting a spinning top, with arrows showing spin direction.  
- **Statement Box:** A **twist** is a push and a pull. You can twist a spinning top to make it move.  
- **Draw:** “Draw and label some other things we can twist.”  
  - *Example answers:*  
    - A bottle with a twist-off lid, with an arrow curving around the top of the bottle to show how the lid twists to open.  
    - A doorknob with a curved arrow beside the knob to show how it turns to open the door.  
    - A toy with a wind-up mechanism, with a circular arrow near the wind-up key to show how it twists to make the toy move.

## 5. Designing a Spinning Top  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Elaborate**  
**Differentiation Level 2**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students now design their own spinning top. Remind them of the video they watched, and explain how their design needs to show how a push or a pull makes it move. Students consider how they could make their spinning top go faster, before drawing and labelling what happened in the space provided.

**Activity Flow**  
1. **Instruction Box:** Design your own spinning top. How could you make it go faster?  
2. **Draw Design Ideas:**  
   - “Design ideas:” (in a thought bubble)  
   - *Example answer:* I designed a spinning top with a larger cardboard circle and a longer handle to spin it faster. I might add weights around the circle to keep it balanced.  
3. **Draw and Label What Happened:**  
   - “Draw and label what happened.”  
   - (Students test their top and document their observations; responses will vary.)

## 6. Applying Forces in a New Game: Totem Tennis  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Elaborate**  
**Differentiation Level 3**

**Teaching Notes**  
This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’ attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis. Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster.

**Activity Flow**  
- **Statement Box:** Totem tennis is a game where you hit a ball. The ball is attached to a pole with a rope.  
- **Image:** Boy hitting a ball on the totem tennis pole.  
- **Draw Forces:** “Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing totem tennis.”  
  - *Example answer:* The student could draw the ball on a rope attached to the pole and show an arrow for the push from the paddle and an arrow pulling the ball around the pole.  
- **Describe Speed:** “Describe how you can make the ball go faster.”  
  - *Answer:* You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.

## 7. Making Your Own Spinning Top  
**Duration:** 15 minutes (Checkpoint)  
**Explore, Explain & Evaluate**

**Teaching Notes**  
- Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how they made their spinning top move.  
- This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.  
- Students create their own spinning top from a cardboard circle and a stick, focusing on how twists set it in motion. They draw and label each step in the construction and movement on a flow chart, showing which forces are at work.

**Materials Needed**  
- A small cardboard circle cut-out (pre-cut)  
- A stick  

**Activity Flow**  
1. **Instruction Box:** Make your own spinning top. You will need a small cardboard circle cut-out and a stick.  
2. **Draw Flow Chart:** “Draw and label how you created your spinning top and how you made it move.” Use the steps:
   - **First …**  
   - **Then …**  
   - **Next …**  
   - **Finally …**  
   - *Example flow chart:*  
     1. First, I cut out a cardboard circle.  
     2. Then, I poked a hole in the middle with a pencil and slid a stick through.  
     3. Next, I held the spinning top upright.  
     4. Finally, I twisted the stick to spin the top.  
3. **Animation/Visual Aid:** A short animation or sequence of images showing hands attaching a stick to a round piece of paper and spinning it helps guide students’ construction.
