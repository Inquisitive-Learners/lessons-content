# Toys and Forces  
**Lesson Name:** [Toys and Forces](www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6284-toys-and-forces)  
**Focus Question:** How do toys work?  

---

## 1. Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

*(As stated: “Students are learning to: Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.”)*

---

## 2. Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## 3. Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.  

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.  

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

## Teaching Sequence

### Activity 1: Exploring Push and Pull with a Kendama  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Type:** Video & discussion-response  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

**Student Task:**  
1. Click on the kendama to watch the video.  
2. Respond to:  
   - **Which part is pushed?**  
   - **Which part is pulled?**  

*(Image description alongside task: Cartoon boy thinking with a large question mark above his head.)*

**Model Answers:**  
- Which part is pushed?  
  - *“The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.”*  
- Which part is pulled?  
  - *“We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.”*

### Activity 2: Push and Pull Animations  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Type:** Interactive Rive animations  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

**Student Task:**  
- Interact with two animations:  
  1. Push action: Observe how pushing the stick makes the ball rise.  
  2. Pull action: Observe how pulling the stick helps catch the ball.

*(No written response required.)*

### Activity 3: Exploring Push, Pull and Spinning Tops  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Type:** Draw & discussion-response  

#### 3.1 Cultural Context & Think-Pair-Share  
**Teaching Notes (Part 1):**  
> Explain to students that many cultures make toys that use pushes and pulls. For example, the First Nations Peoples of Australia and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a rich history of using spinning tops as both children's toys and as part of a sporting game played by young men. Have students explore the Australian Museum’s website to view what the First Nations Australians' spinning tops toys looked like. Ask them to choose one of the spinning tops and talk about how it was made, then draw what it looks like.

**Student Task (Think, Pair, Share):**  
- Draw several toys and use arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.

**Model Answers:**  
Students might draw:  
- A toy car with an arrow pointing forward from the back (push).  
- A pull-along animal with an arrow from the toy toward the child’s hand (pull).  
- A yo-yo going up and down with one arrow down (push) and one up (pull).  

#### 3.2 Identify Other Toys  
**Teaching Notes (Part 2):**  
> Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

**Student Task:**  
- What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work? (Text/draw/upload)  

**Model Answers:**  
Examples include: toy wagons, pull-string spinning toys, push-along walkers, bouncy balls, spring-loaded launchers, etc.

#### 3.3 Watching Another Spinning Top  
**Teaching Notes (Part 3):**  
> Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.

**Student Task:**  
- Why is the spinning top moving?  
- How is it moving?  

**Model Answers:**  
- Why?  
  - *“It's moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.”*  
- How?  
  - *“It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It also propels forward slowly with the spinning force.”*  

*(Video plays in two-column layout.)*

#### 3.4 Cultural Spinning Tops  
**Teaching Notes (Part 4):**  
> Students investigate spinning tops made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and discuss what makes them move. Encourage them to explore which forces are used and reflect on the materials used. Ask students to share what they found interesting about the spinning tops.

**Student Task:**  
- Who used the spinning tops?  
- What are they made from?  
- What did you find interesting?  
- How do they move?  

**Model Answers:**  
- Who used them?  
  - *“Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples used spinning tops. Children use them for fun and men use them for competitions.”*  
- Made from:  
  - *“Small gourds mounted on sticks and secured with fibre and resin.”*  
  - *“Beeswax attached to a thin stick of wood.”*  
- Interesting:  
  - Student-varied.  
- How they move:  
  - *“They spin around when you twist or flick them.”*

### Activity 4: Understanding Twist as Push + Pull  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Type:** Image exploration & draw  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students learn that a twist can be described as a combination of a push and a pull. Ask the students to think of, and draw some other examples of things they can twist.

*(Image description: Hand using fingers to twist a spinning top; arrows show the top will spin.)*

**Student Task:**  
- Draw and label some other things we can twist.

**Model Answers:**  
Students might draw and label:  
- A bottle with a twist-off lid (arrow curving around the top).  
- A doorknob with a curved arrow beside it.  
- A wind-up toy key with a circular arrow.

### Activity 5: Making Your Own Spinning Top  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Checkpoint:** Yes  
**Type:** Instruction & create  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how they made their spinning top move.

**Materials Needed:**  
- A small cardboard circle cut-out  
- A stick  

**Student Task:**  
1. Follow the steps shown in the animation and images to assemble your spinning top (circle + stick).  
2. Draw and label how you created your spinning top and how you made it move, using a flow chart:  
   - First …  
   - Then …  
   - Next …  
   - Finally …  

*(Flow-chart image with labels “First … Then … Next … Finally …”)*

**Model Answer (Example Flow Chart):**  
- First, I cut out a cardboard circle.  
- Then, I poked a hole in the middle with a pencil and slid a stick through.  
- Next, I held the spinning top upright.  
- Finally, I twisted the stick to spin the top.

### Activity 6: Design Your Own Spinning Top (Enrichment)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Differentiation Level:** 2  
**Type:** Draw & explain  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students now design their own spinning top. Remind them of the video they watched, and explain how their design needs to show how a push or a pull makes it move. Students consider how they could make their spinning top go faster, before drawing and labelling what happened in the space provided.

**Student Task:**  
1. **Design ideas:** Sketch ideas in the thought bubble: “How could you make it go faster?”  
2. **Experiment & observe:** Build your design.  
3. **Draw and label what happened.**

**Model Answer (Design Ideas):**  
- “I designed a spinning top with a larger cardboard circle and a longer handle to spin it faster. I might add weights around the circle to keep it balanced.”

*(Experiment drawing varies by student.)*

### Activity 7: Totem Tennis – Applying Push and Pull  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Differentiation Level:** 3  
**Type:** Draw & text response  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’ attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis. Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster.

*(Image description: Boy hitting a ball on the totem tennis structure with a paddle.)*

**Student Task:**  
1. Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing Totem Tennis.  
2. Describe how you can make the ball go faster.

**Model Answers:**  
- Diagram: Show an arrow from the paddle pushing the ball outward, an arrow along the rope pulling the ball around the pole.  
- Make faster: “You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.”
