## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

### Section 1: Kendama Toy and Forces  
**Activity:** Watch the Kendama video and identify pushes versus pulls  
- **Duration:** 5 minutes  
- **Student Instructions:**  
  - “Which part is pushed?”  
  - “Which part is pulled?”  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.  
- **Answers:**  
  - Which part is pushed?  
    - *The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.*  
  - Which part is pulled?  
    - *We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.*

---

### Section 2: Push and Pull Animations  
**Activity:** Explore push and pull forces with animations  
- **Duration:** 5 minutes  
- **Student Instructions:** Interact with the two animations: one illustrating a push sending the kendama ball up, the other a pull catching the ball.  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

---

### Section 3: Many Toys Need a Push, Pull or Both  
**Activity:** Think, Pair, Share and Draw forces on familiar toys  
- **Duration:** 15 minutes  
- **Statement Box:** Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.  
- **Think, Pair, Share:** Students discuss examples.  
- **Draw:**  
  - “Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.”  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.  
- **Answers:**  
  - *Draw examples such as:*  
    - A small toy car with an arrow pointing forward from the back (push).  
    - A pull-along animal with an arrow from the toy toward the child’s hand (pull).  
    - A yo-yo on a string with one arrow down (push) and one up (pull).  
  - What other toys do you know?  
    - *Toy cars or trucks; push-along trolleys; bouncing balls; dominoes; scooters; toy wagons; pull-along animals; yo-yos; spinning pull-string toys; etc.*

#### 3.2 Spinning Tops Video & Cultural Perspectives  
**Activity:** Watch another spinning top video and discuss; explore cultural examples  
- **Teaching Notes (video):**  
  > Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.  
- **Student Instructions & Answers:**  
  - “Why is the spinning top moving?”  
    - *It’s moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.*  
  - “How is it moving?”  
    - *It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It is also propelling forward slowly with the spinning force.*  
- **Teaching Notes (cultural exploration):**  
  > Students investigate spinning tops made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and discuss what makes them move. Encourage them to explore which forces are used and reflect on the materials used. Ask students to share what they found interesting about the spinning tops.  
- **Student Instructions & Answers:**  
  - “Who used the spinning tops?”  
    - *Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples used spinning tops. Children use them for fun and men use them for competitions.*  
  - “What are they made from?”  
    - *They are made from small gourds mounted on sticks and secured with fibre and resin; some are made from beeswax attached to thin wooden sticks.*  
  - “What did you find interesting?”  
    - *They spin around when you twist or flick them.*  
  - “How do they move?”  
    - *They spin around when you twist or flick them.*  
  - *Visit the Australian Museum website (link provided) to explore real examples and discuss further.*

### Section 4: Twisting as Push and Pull  
**Activity:** Understand twisting as a combination of push and pull  
- **Duration:** 10 minutes  
- **Image Alt Text:** Hand using fingers to twist a spinning top, arrows showing that the spinning top will spin round.  
- **Instruction:**  
  - “Draw and label some other things we can twist.”  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > Students learn that a twist can be described as a combination of a push and a pull. Ask the students to think of, and draw some other examples of things they can twist.  
- **Answers:**  
  - *Students might draw:*  
    - A bottle with a twist-off lid, arrow curving around the top.  
    - A doorknob with a curved arrow beside it.  
    - A wind-up toy key with a circular arrow.

### Section 5: Creating Your Own Spinning Top (Checkpoint)  
**Activity:** Make and test a spinning top from cardboard and a stick (*Checkpoint*)  
- **Duration:** 15 minutes  
- **Instruction Box:**  
  - “Make your own spinning top. You will need a small cardboard circle cut-out and a stick.”  
- **Instruction:**  
  - “Draw and label how you created your spinning top and how you made it move.” (Use the flow chart frames: First…, Then…, Next…, Finally…)  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how they made their spinning top move.  
  > This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.  
  > Students create their own spinning top from a cardboard circle and a stick, focusing on how twists set it in motion. They draw and label each step in the construction and movement on a flow chart, showing which forces are at work.  
- **Materials Needed:**  
  - Small cardboard circle cut-out (cut into round circles)  
  - Stick  
- **Answers (Example flow chart):**  
  1. First, I cut out a cardboard circle.  
  2. Then, I poked a hole in the middle with a pencil and slid a stick through.  
  3. Next, I held the spinning top upright.  
  4. Finally, I twisted the stick to spin the top.

### Section 6: Design Your Own Spinning Top  
**Activity:** Design, build and evaluate a faster spinner  
- **Duration:** 20 minutes  
- **Instruction Box:**  
  - “Design your own spinning top. How could you make it go faster?”  
- **Sub-Activities:**  
  1. **Design ideas:** “Design ideas:” (empty thought bubble)  
  2. **Test & Record:** “Draw and label what happened.”  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > Students now design their own spinning top. Remind them of the video they watched, and explain how their design needs to show how a push or a pull makes it move. Students consider how they could make their spinning top go faster, before drawing and labelling what happened in the space provided.  
  > Students design their own spinning top and explore how to make it spin faster. Encourage them to experiment with size, shape or materials and note any changes in speed. Have them draw and label their findings, explaining which ideas worked best for a faster spin.  
- **Answer (Example):**  
  *I designed a spinning top with a larger cardboard circle and a longer handle to spin it faster. I might add weights around the circle to keep it balanced.*

### Section 7: Totem Tennis Forces  
**Activity:** Investigate push and pull forces in Totem Tennis  
- **Duration:** 20 minutes  
- **Info-Box:** “Totem tennis is a game where you hit a ball. The ball is attached to a pole with a rope.”  
- **Image Alt Text:** Boy hitting a ball on the totem tennis structure with a paddle.  
- **Sub-Activities:**  
  1. **Draw:** “Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing totem tennis.”  
  2. **Describe:** “Describe how you can make the ball go faster.”  
- **Teaching Notes:**  
  > This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’ attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis. Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster.  
  > Students explore the game of totem tennis to see how hitting the ball makes it move around the pole. Prompt students to draw and label the directions of forces they think are in action, and reflect on which force makes the ball go faster. Have them explain these forces in their diagrams and describe their impact on speed.  
- **Answers (Examples):**  
  - **Diagram:** The student could draw the ball on a rope attached to the pole, with an arrow from the paddle showing the push, and an arrow on the rope showing the pull around the pole.  
  - **Make it go faster:** You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.
