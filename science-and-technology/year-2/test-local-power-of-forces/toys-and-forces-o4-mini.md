## Focus Question  
**How do toys work?**

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a **flow chart to describe the process of** making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

## Section 1 (V): Engage – Kendama Video

### Activity 1: Kendama Push and Pull  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

**Content & Instructions:**  
1. A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.  
2. Click on the kendama to watch the video.  
3. Discuss:  
   - **Which part is pushed?**  
   - **Which part is pulled?**  

**Student Response Components:**  
- Draw or text response for “Which part is pushed?”  
- Draw or text response for “Which part is pulled?”  

**Example Answers:**  
- **Which part is pushed?**  
  > The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.  
- **Which part is pulled?**  
  > We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.

## Section 2 (o): Explore – Push and Pull Animations

### Activity 2: Push & Pull Demonstrations  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

**Content & Instructions:**  
- Statement: “When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.”  
- Statement: “When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.”  
- Interactive animations:  
  - **Push** animation (alt text: Child with a push stick, focused on making a ball rise above his hand.)  
  - **Pull** animation (alt text: A child with a toy demonstrating the actions "Pull stick" and "Catch ball".)  
- Students observe labels and discuss the cause-effect of each action.

## Section 3 (s): Explain – Push & Pull on Other Toys

### Activity 3: Think, Pair, Share & Draw Forces  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

**Content & Instructions:**  
1. Statement box: “Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.”  
2. *Think, Pair, Share* to list examples.  
3. **Draw** examples below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.  
4. **Discuss**: “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?”

**Example Answers (Draw & List):**  
- Toy car on a flat surface with an arrow pointing forward (push).  
- Pull-along animal with wheels, arrow toward hand (pull).  
- Yo-yo on a string going up and down with one arrow down (push), one up (pull).  
- Text list of push toys: toy cars, push-along trolleys, bouncing balls, dominoes, scooters.  
- Text list of pull toys: toy wagons, pull-along animals, yo-yos, spinning pull-string toys.

#### Subsection 3.1 (V): Video of Another Spinning Top

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.

**Content & Instructions:**  
- Instruction box: “Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.”  
- **Video** (stimulusId 19250)  
- **Discuss:**  
  - “Why is the spinning top moving?”  
  - “How is it moving?”

**Example Answers:**  
- **Why is it moving?**  
  > It's moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.  
- **How is it moving?**  
  > It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It is also propelling forward slowly with the spinning force.

## Section 7 (zV): Elaborate – Totem Tennis

### Activity 7: Forces in Action  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’ attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis. Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster.

**Content & Instructions:**  
- Statement box: “Totem tennis is a game where you hit a ball. The ball is attached to a pole with a rope.”  
- Image (alt text: Boy hitting a ball on the totem tennis structure with a paddle.)  
- **Draw and label a diagram** using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing totem tennis.  
- **Describe:** “How can you make the ball go faster?”

**Example Drawing Description:**  
> The students could draw the ball on a rope attached to the pole and show an arrow for the push from the paddle and an arrow pulling the ball around the pole.

**Example Answer (Making It Go Faster):**  
> You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.
