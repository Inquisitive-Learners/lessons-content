---

## Focus Question  
**How do toys work?**  

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.  

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

# Teaching Sequence & Activities

---

## Activity 1: Exploring the Kendama (5 minutes)  
**Component ID:** 7HpjbEkfuwUu  

### Teaching Notes  
Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

### Resources & Setup  
- **Info‐box**:  
  A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.  
- **Instruction**: Click on the kendama to watch the video.  
- **Video** (Stimulus 3741) embedded.  
- **Image** (alt: Cartoon boy thinking with a large question mark above his head.)

### Student Tasks  
1. **Discussion‐response**  
   - Which part is pushed?  
   - Which part is pulled?

### Answers  
- **Which part is pushed?**  
  *The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.*  
- **Which part is pulled?**  
  *We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.*

---

## Activity 2: Push & Pull Animations (5 minutes)  
**Component ID:** puqFUa8mfg2s  

### Teaching Notes  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

### Resources & Setup  
- **Info‐box** (left column):  
  When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.  
- **Info‐box** (right column):  
  When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.  
- **Rive animation 1** (alt: Child with a push stick, focused on making a ball rise above his hand) – labels: Push / Push stick / Ball goes up  
- **Rive animation 2** (alt: A child with a toy demonstrating the actions “Pull stick” and “Catch ball”) – labels: Pull / Pull stick / Catch ball  

(No student response component—this is teacher‐led demonstration.)

## Activity 3: Other Toys that Use Push, Pull or Both (15 minutes)  
**Component ID:** wxTCCoBmDEhx  

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

### Resources & Setup  
- **Statement box** (wide centre):  
  Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.  
- **Coloured box** (left): *Think, Pair, Share.*  
- **Draw area** (instructions visible):  
  Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.  
- **Discussion** (right column):  
  What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?

### Student Tasks  
1. **Draw** examples of toys with arrows showing forces.  
2. **Discuss / write / draw** other toys that need push/pull.

### Example Answers  
- A small toy car on a flat surface with an arrow pointing forward from the back.  
- A pull-along animal on wheels with an arrow pointing from the toy toward the child’s hand.  
- A yo-yo on a string going up and down with one arrow pointing down (push) and one pointing up (pull).
