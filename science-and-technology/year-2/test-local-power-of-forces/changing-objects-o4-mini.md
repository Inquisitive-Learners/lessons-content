## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## 4. Changing Speed (5 min)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students learn that a push or pull can change the **speed** of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using different amounts of force.”  

**Statement**  
A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.  

**Discussion Questions**  
1. How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?  
   - *Example Answer:* One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
2. How did the batter change the speed of the balls?  
   - *Example Answer:* The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.  

**Video**  
Short clip of a boy batting balls.

## 5. Changing Direction (5 min)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students learn that a push or pull can change the **direction** of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce different results. They describe or demonstrate these possibilities to show their understanding of how a force can control the direction of a moving object.”  

**Statement**  
A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.  

**Discussion Questions**  
1. In what direction did the ball move?  
   - *Example Answer:* The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
2. How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?  
   - *Example Answer:* The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
3. Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?  
   - *Example Answer:* Yes, if the goalie kicked or pushed the ball from another angle it would travel a different way, or if the goalie stopped it differently it might bounce off in a new direction. The goalie could also have caught the ball to stop it from moving completely.  

**Video**  
Short clip of soccer goalkeeper deflecting a ball.

## 6. Stopping Objects (5 min)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion. They apply this idea to understand how a ball or bike can be stopped, or how balloons can be held in place to keep them from moving.”  

**Statement**  
A push or a pull can make an object **stop** moving too.  

**Discussion**  
How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?  

**Resources** (three examples)  
- Girl catching a ball on grass.  
- Child riding a bike, wearing a helmet.  
- Child holding balloons by a string against the sky.  

**Example Answers**  
- The girl is about to catch the ball by pushing against the direction it’s moving in. This will cause the ball to stop.  
- To stop the bike, the rider pushes or pulls the brakes.  
- A child pulls the string down to stop the balloons from flying away.

## 7. Predict & Explain – Balloon Forces (15 min)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. Students refine their thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner. Have them explain their predictions to show their understanding.”  

**Statement**  
Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.  

**Instructions**  
With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.  

**Resource**  
Image of a red balloon with eyes saying “Move me!”  

**Sentence Prompts**  
1. I can make the balloon move by …  
2. I can change the balloon’s direction by …  
3. I can make the balloon move faster by …  
4. I can stop the balloon from moving by …  

*(Students discuss and record their own responses.)*  

---

### 7a. Test Predictions – Balloon (Student)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students test their predictions using an inflated balloon and observe how it moves or changes direction when pushed or pulled. They look for patterns in how the strength and direction of each force affects the balloon’s movement. They record their observations by completing cause and effect sentences and creating a labelled drawing with arrows to show the direction of the force.”  

**Instructions**  
With a classmate, use an inflated balloon to test your ideas.  

**Sentence Prompts**  
1. I ________ so it moved.  
   - *Suggested:* pushed the balloon against the floor.  
2. I ________ so it changed direction.  
   - *Suggested:* pulled the balloon towards me.  

**Drawing**  
Draw what happened. Use an arrow to show the direction of the force. *(Two scenarios.)*  

**Question**  
Did your results match your predictions?  
- Yes *(correct)* / No  

**Question**  
Did any of your results surprise you?  
*(Students record free-text responses.)*

## 8. Tug-of-War Interactive (10 min)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students play an interactive *Tug-of-War* game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope, connecting equal and unequal forces to real-life examples. Encourage students to compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect the movement of the rope.”  

**Instructions**  
Click on the interactive to play a game of *Tug-of-War* with some furry friends.  
- Explore what happens when you drag dogs of different sizes to the left and right sides of the rope.  
- Press “Go” to see what happens to the rope.  
- Answer the questions on the next page.  

---

### 8a. Reflect on Forces (Student)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students record their observations by answering the questions, showing how the size and strength of a force can affect an object’s movement. Challenge students to physically test the idea of equal forces with a classmate by trying to keep a rope still.”  

**Question Prompts**  
1. How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn’t move?  
   - *Example Answer:* The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope did not move.  
2. What needed to happen to make the rope move?  
   - *Example Answer:* One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer balanced.  
3. How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?  
   - *Example Answer:* The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope to move in that direction.  
4. What needed to happen to keep the rope still?  
   - *Example Answer:* Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced so the rope stayed in place.

## 9. Push & Pull Combo (10 min)  
**Teaching Notes**  
“Students consider how some objects need a push and a pull to work. They explore opening and closing a window and colouring with a crayon, drawing pictures with arrows to show the direction of force used in each example.”  

**Statement**  
Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for it to work.  

**Instruction**  
Draw a picture with arrows showing the direction of the forces for each example. Label the arrows with **push** or **pull**.  

**Examples**  
1. Opening and closing a window
