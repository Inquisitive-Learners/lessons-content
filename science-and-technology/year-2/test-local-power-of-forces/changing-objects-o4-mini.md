# Lesson: Changing Objects

**URL:** https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects  
**Focus Question:** What can a push or a pull do?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, **"What can a push or a pull do?"** Encourage students to share personal experiences, such as playing with balls, opening doors or using household objects to explore how pushes and pulls cause things to move. Document students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

### Part B: Student Practice  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw their playdough’s shape after pushing it and then pulling it to document how it has changed. Encourage them to compare their new shape with how it looked before, reinforcing how the force they applied produced differences. They then complete the sentences to describe the cause and effect.

#### Instructions to Students  
1. Draw what your playdough looks like.  
2. Draw what your playdough looks like now.  
3. Complete the sentence:  
   - Sentence 1: “I ____ the playdough so it makes a flat pancake.”  
   - Sentence 2: “I ____ the playdough so it makes a long snake.”

#### Expected Answers  
- Sentence 1: **push**  
- Sentence 2: **pull**

## Activity 4: Changing Speed of Objects  
**Duration:** 5 minutes **Differentiation Level:** 1  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using different amounts of force.

### Instructions to Students  
- A push or a pull can change the speed of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.  
- How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?  
- How did the batter change the speed of the balls?

### Content  
- Video: boy batting balls of different strength swings.

### Expected Answers  
- **How strong was the force of the bat on each ball?**  
  - One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
- **How did the batter change the speed of the balls?**  
  - The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.

## Activity 5: Changing Direction of a Moving Object  
**Duration:** 5 minutes **Differentiation Level:** 1  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce different results. They describe or demonstrate these possibilities to show their understanding of how a force can control the direction of a moving object.

### Instructions to Students  
- A push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object.  
- In what direction did the ball move?  
- How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?  
- Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?

### Content  
- Video: goalkeeper diving to catch a football.

### Expected Answers  
- **In what direction did the ball move?**  
  - The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
- **How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?**  
  - The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
- **Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?**  
  - Yes, if the goalie kicked or pushed the ball from another angle it would travel a different way, or if the goalie stopped it differently it might bounce off in a new direction. The goalie could also have caught the ball to stop it from moving completely.

## Activity 6: Predicting Balloon Movement  
**Duration:** 15 minutes **Differentiation Level:** 1  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. Students refine their thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner. Have them explain their predictions to show their understanding.

### Instructions to Students  
- Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.  
- With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.

### Content  
- Image: smiling red balloon saying “Move me!”

#### Student Responses (open-ended)  
- I can make the balloon move by …  
- I can change the balloon’s direction by …  
- I can make the balloon move faster by …  
- I can stop the balloon from moving by …

## Activity 7: Stopping Objects  
**Duration:** 5 minutes **Differentiation Level:** 1  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion. They apply this idea to understand how a ball or bike can be stopped, or how balloons can be held in place to keep them from moving.

### Instructions to Students  
- A push or a pull can make an object stop moving too.  
- How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?

### Content  
- Image: girl stopping a red ball with her gloves.  
- Image: girl stopping a pink bicycle.  
- Image: child pulling balloons down to stop them flying away.

### Teacher Models  
- The girl is about to catch the ball by pushing against the direction it's moving in. This will cause the ball to stop.  
- To stop the bike, the rider pushes or pulls the brakes.  
- A child pulls the string down to stop the balloons from flying away.

## Activity 8: Sort Tiles – Push or Pull?  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students sort the tiles into things that stopped moving because of a push, and things that stopped moving because of a pull.

### Instructions to Students  
Sort the tiles to show how a push or a pull can stop something from moving.

### Content  
Six picture tiles (e.g., dog on a leash, go-kart race, goalkeeper catching a ball, child sliding off slide, woman flying a kite, person pulling a rope on a boat).

### Expected Answers  
**Push**  
- Go-karts are stopped when the driver pushes the brake pedal.  
- The goalkeeper pushes the ball away.  
- The child on the slide uses her feet to push up to standing to stop herself from sliding off.  

**Pull**  
- The barking dog is held still by pulling on its lead.  
- The kite is stopped from flying away by pulling the string.  
- The rope on the boat is pulled to control the sail’s movement.

## Activity 9: Tug-of-War with Furry Friends  
**Duration:** 10 minutes **Differentiation Level:** 2  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students play an interactive _Tug-of-War_ game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope, connecting equal and unequal forces to real-life examples. Encourage students to compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect the movement of the rope.

### Instructions to Students  
1. Click on the interactive to play a game of _Tug-of-War_ with some furry friends.  
2. Explore what happens when you drag dogs of different sizes to the left and right sides of the rope.  
3. Press “Go” to see what happens to the rope.  
4. Answer the questions on the next page.

### Student Questions & Expected Answers  
- **How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn’t move?**  
  - The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope stayed in place.  
- **What needed to happen to make the rope move?**  
  - One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer balanced, causing the rope to move in that direction.  
- **How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?**  
  - The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope to move in that direction.  
- **What needed to happen to keep the rope still?**  
  - Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced so the rope stayed in place.

## Activity 10: Combined Push and Pull  
**Differentiation Level:** 3  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students consider how some objects need a push and a pull to work. They explore opening and closing a window and colouring with a crayon, drawing pictures with arrows to show the direction of force used in each example.

### Instructions to Students  
- Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for it to work.  
- Draw a picture with arrows showing the direction of the forces for each example. Label the arrows with **push** or **pull**.

### Examples to Draw  
- Opening and closing a window.  
- Using a crayon to colour in.
