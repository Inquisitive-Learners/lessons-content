## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and Pulls**  
> A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.

**Changing shapes**  
> Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.

**Changing speed**  
> Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

**Changing direction and stopping**  
> Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## Activity 2 (5 min): A Push or Pull Can Change Objects  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn a push or pull can change objects. They observe pictures of objects being changed by pushes and pulls, and then act them out. Prompt students to think about how each force changes the objects so they see the impact of forces in everyday situations.

**What’s being taught**  
- A push or pull can compress or stretch materials and change their appearance.

**Steps**  
1. Display statement box: **“A push or a pull can change objects.”**  
2. Show two images side by side:  
   - Hands rolling dough with a rolling pin (alt: “Hands rolling dough on a floured surface, preparing for baking.”)  
   - Girl holding colourful springs (alt: “Girl with long hair in a yellow beanie poses against a yellow background, holding colourful springs.”)  
3. Ask and collect responses:  
   - **“What is being pushed?”**  
   - **“What is being pulled?”**  
   - **“How does a push or a pull change the object?”**  
4. Act out what is happening in the pictures.

**Answers**  
- *What is being pushed?*  
  > The rolling pin is being pushed back and forth. The dough is being pushed down and out by the weight of the rolling pin.  
- *What is being pulled?*  
  > The colourful spiral spring is being pulled by the girl.  
- *How does a push or a pull change the object?*  
  > • A push can flatten or stretch dough.  
  > • A pull can make it longer or thinner.

## Activity 3 (15 min): Change Shape  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or a pull can change the shape of an object. They read and complete sentences describing how a push or pull can change an object’s shape.

**What’s being taught**  
- How a push can flatten an object.  
- How a pull can elongate an object.  

### Part A: Teacher Demonstration  
1. Display statement: **“A push or a pull can change the shape of an object.”**  
2. Show images:  
   - Child pressing playdough into a flat pancake (alt: “A child's hands pressing down on soft, white playdough making a pancake shape.”)

## Activity 4 (5 min): Change Speed  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using different amounts of force.

**What’s being taught**  
- Stronger pushes result in faster, farther movement.  
- Weaker pushes result in slower, shorter movement.

**Steps**  
1. Display statement: **“A push or a pull can change the speed of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.”**  
2. Show video of a boy batting balls.  
3. Discuss:  
   - **“How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?”**  
   - **“How did the batter change the speed of the balls?”**

**Answers**  
- *How strong was the force…?*  
  > One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
- *How did the batter change…?*  
  > The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.

## Activity 5 (5 min): Change Direction  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce different results. They describe or demonstrate these possibilities to show their understanding of how a force can control the direction of a moving object.

**What’s being taught**  
- A force applied at an angle can redirect motion.

**Steps**  
1. Display statement: **“A push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object.”**  
2. Show video of a goalkeeper diving to catch a football.  
3. Discuss:  
   - **“In what direction did the ball move?”**  
   - **“How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?”**  
   - **“Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?”**

**Answers**  
- *In what direction…?*  
  > The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
- *How did the goalie…?*  
  > The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
- *Could the ball…?*  
  > Yes, if the goalie kicked or pushed the ball from another angle it would travel a different way, or if the goalie stopped it differently it might bounce off in a new direction. The goalie could also have caught the ball to stop it from moving completely.

## Activity 6 (5 min): Stop Moving Objects  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion. They apply this idea to understand how a ball or bike can be stopped, or how balloons can be held in place to keep them from moving.

**What’s being taught**  
- A force applied opposite to motion can bring an object to rest.

**Steps**  
1. Display statement: **“A push or a pull can make an object stop moving too.”**  
2. Show three images:  
   - A girl playing with a red ball in autumn field (alt: “A girl in a warm coat and gloves plays with a red ball on a grassy, autumnal field.”)  
   - A girl riding a bicycle (alt: “A young girl rides a pink bicycle, smiling, wearing a helmet and bright clothing in a park.”)  
   - A child holding down balloons (alt: “Child in sunglasses joyfully holds a bunch of colourful balloons against a clear blue sky pulling them down using a string.”)  
3. Discuss: **“How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?”**

**Answers**  
> • The girl is about to catch the ball by pushing against the direction it's moving in. This will cause the ball to stop.  
> • To stop the bike, the rider pushes or pulls the brakes.  
> • A child pulls the string down to stop the balloons from flying away.

### Sub-Activity: Sort “Push” vs. “Pull”  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students sort the tiles into things that stopped moving because of a push, and things that stopped moving because of a pull.

**Instructions**  
- Sort the images/tiles of:  
  - Stopping a dog from running away (pull)  
  - Stopping a go-kart (push)  
  - Stopping a ball (push)  
  - Stopping a slide–rider (push)  
  - Stopping a kite (pull)  
  - Stopping a boat (pull)

**Answers / Exemplars**  
- **Push**  
  > • Go-karts are stopped when the driver pushes the brake pedal.  
  > • The goalkeeper pushes the ball away.  
  > • The child on the slide uses her feet to push up to standing to stop herself from sliding off.  
- **Pull**  
  > • The barking dog is held still by pulling on its lead.  
  > • The kite is stopped from flying away by pulling the string.  
  > • The rope on the boat is pulled to control the sail’s movement.

## Activity 7 (15 min): Predict Balloon Movement  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. Students refine their thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner. Have them explain their predictions to show their understanding.

**What’s being taught**  
- How varying force can change an object’s movement (position, direction, speed, stop).

**Steps**  
1. Display statement:  
   > “Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.”  
2. Instruction: **“With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.”**  
3. Show balloon image (alt: “A smiling red balloon with big eyes says, ‘Move me!’ in a speech bubble.”)  
4. Student responses (text/draw/upload) to:  
   - **“I can make the balloon move by …”**  
   - **“I can change the balloon’s direction by …”**  
   - **“I can make the balloon move faster by …”**  
   - **“I can stop the balloon from moving by …”**

**Answers**  
*(Open-ended; teacher circulates to assess predictions.)*

## Activity 8 (10 min): Tug-of-War Interactive  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students play an interactive *Tug-of-War* game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope, connecting equal and unequal forces to real-life examples. Encourage students to compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect the movement of the rope.

**What’s being taught**  
- The concept of balanced vs. unbalanced forces.

**Steps**  
1. Instruction: **“Click on the interactive to play a game of *Tug-of-War* with some furry friends.”**  
2. Explore dragging dogs of different sizes to left and right, then press “Go” to see rope movement.  
3. After play, record observations by answering questions on the next page.

**Sub-Activity: Record Observations**  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students record their observations by answering the questions, showing how the size and strength of a force can affect an object's movement. Challenge students to physically test the idea of equal forces with a classmate by trying to keep a rope still.

**Questions & Answers**  
- **“How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn't move?”**  
  > The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope did not move.  
- **“What needed to happen to make the rope move?”**  
  > One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer balanced.  
- **“How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?”**  
  > The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope to move in that direction.  
- **“What needed to happen to keep the rope still?”**  
  > Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced so the rope stayed in place.

## Activity 9 (10 min, Differentiation 3): Push and Pull Together  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students consider how some objects need a push and a pull to work. They explore opening and closing a window and colouring with a crayon, drawing pictures with arrows to show the direction of force used in each example.

**What’s being taught**  
- Sequencing forces: push then pull, or pull then push.

### Part A: Directed Examples  
1. Instruction: **“Draw a picture with arrows showing the direction of the forces for each example. Label the arrows with push or pull.”**  
2. Two scenarios side by side:  
   - **Opening and closing a window**  
     - Students draw arrows showing pushing the handle up (to open) then pulling down (to close).  
     - **Example Answer (image):** window image illustrating push/pull.  
   - **Using a crayon to colour in**  
     - Students draw arrows showing push of the crayon tip into paper then pull across surface.  
     - **Example Answer (image):** photo of child colouring with crayon.

*(Source: Student submissions: images of window and crayon.)*

### Part B: Create Own Examples  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students create their own examples of scenarios that require both pushes and pulls. They label each force arrow clearly, showing their understanding of which direction each force moves.

**Instructions**  
- Draw and label two new scenarios showing a push and a pull sequence.

**Example Responses**  
- Students might illustrate something like pushing a drawer to close it and pulling it to open it, labelling the arrows push or pull.  
- Students might draw rowing a boat where the oar needs to be pushed and pulled to move the boat.
