## Learning Intention  
Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object’s movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words (low-frequency, subject-specific). Focus instruction on building content knowledge within the lesson. Vocabulary words appear in **bold**.

### Activity 4: Changing Speed (5 min)  
**Phase:** Explain  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a video of a boy batting balls and notice each ball travels a different distance. They discuss how the strength of the push (bat swing) affects speed and distance.

**Statement:**  
> A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.

**Video:**  
Boy batting balls at varying strengths.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
1. **How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?**  
   _Answer:_ One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
2. **How did the batter change the speed of the balls?**  
   _Answer:_ The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.

### Activity 5: Predicting Balloon Motion (15 min, checkpoint)  
**Phases:** Explain / Evaluate  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. They share ideas with a partner and explain their predictions.

**Statement:**  
> Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.

**Instructions:**  
With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.

*(Image: Smiling red balloon with big eyes saying “Move me!”)*

**Prompts:**  
- I can make the balloon move by …  
- I can change the balloon’s direction by …  
- I can make the balloon move faster by …  
- I can stop the balloon from moving by …

> *(Students discuss and share.)*

#### 5a. Testing Predictions with a Balloon  
**Materials:** Inflated balloon  

1. **Sentence Completion:**  
   - “I ___ so it moved.”  
     _Answer:_ pushed the balloon away from me  
   - “I ___ so it changed direction.”  
     _Answer:_ pulled the balloon towards me  

2. **Drawing:**  
   Draw what happened. Use an arrow to show the direction of the force.

3. **Reflection:**  
   - Did your results match your predictions? (Yes / No)  
   - Did any of your results surprise you?  
     _Answer:_ *(Open response)*

### Activity 8: Both Push and Pull (Differentiation)  
**Phase:** Elaborate  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students consider scenarios requiring both a push and a pull, then draw and label arrows for forces.

**Statement:**  
> Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for it to work.

**Instructions:**  
Draw a picture with arrows showing the direction of the forces for each example. Label the arrows **push** or **pull**.

1. **Opening and closing a window**  
   _Example Answer (image) provided._  
2. **Using a crayon to colour in**  
   _Example Answer (image) provided._

### Activity 9: Tug-of-War Game (10 min, differentiation)  
**Phase:** Elaborate  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students play an interactive *Tug-of-War* game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope. They compare balanced and unbalanced forces.

**Interactive:** Tug-of-War with furry friends.

#### 9a. Observation Questions  
1. **Rope didn’t move:** How would you describe the forces on each side?  
   _Answer:_ The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope did not move.  
2. **Rope moved:** What needed to happen?  
   _Answer:_ One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer balanced.  
3. **When rope moved:** How would you describe the forces on each side?  
   _Answer:_ The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope to move in that direction.  
4. **Keeping rope still:** What needed to happen?  
   _Answer:_ Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced so the rope stayed in place.

### Activity 10: Changing Direction with a Force (5 min)  
**Phases:** Explore / Explain  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a video of a soccer goalie and discuss force direction.

**Statement:**  
> A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.

**Video:** Soccer goalie in action.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
1. **In what direction did the ball move?**  
   _Answer:_ The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
2. **How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?**  
   _Answer:_ The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
3. **Could it have moved in a different direction? How?**  
   _Answer:_ Yes. If the goalie kicked or pushed the ball from another angle, it would travel a different way. They could also have caught it to stop it completely.
