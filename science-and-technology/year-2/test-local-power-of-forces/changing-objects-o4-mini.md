# Lesson: Pushes and Pulls

**Focus Question**  
What can a push or a pull do?

---

## Introduction  
Show the cover image (a child in a cap aiming a wooden slingshot, squinting with focus). Ask:  
“What can a push or a pull do?”  
Invite students to share personal experiences (e.g. playing with balls, opening doors) and document responses to gauge understanding and misconceptions.

---

## Teacher Knowledge  
**Pushes and pulls**  
- A **push** is a force that moves an object away from you.  
- A **pull** moves an object towards you.

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to recognize that a force can change an object in different ways.

---

## 4. Speed Change with Batting  
**Section** fg0XVLgCySyg (Teacher) | Duration: 5 min  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or pull can change the **speed** of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using different amounts of force.  

### Flow  
1. Statement Box:  
   > A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.  
2. Two‐column layout: left blank for video, right for discussion.  
3. Show video (stimulusId: 19216) of batting balls.  
4. Discussion Prompts (boxed):  
   - How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?  
   - How did the batter change the speed of the balls?  

### Answers (Examples)  
- One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
- The batter swung the bat at different speeds; a gentle swing made the ball move slowly, a faster swing sent it speeding across the field.

## 5. Predicting Balloon Movement  
**Section** KqD9uE1vrpJQ (Teacher) | Duration: 15 min (Checkpoint)  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. Students refine their thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner. Have them explain their predictions to show their understanding.  

### Flow  
1. Statement Box:  
   > Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.  
2. Instruction Box:  
   > With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.  
3. Show columns: left wide for responses; right for balloon image with speech bubble “Move me!”

### 5a. Test with Balloon  
**Section** upcZAgyu4D9Q (Student)  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students test their predictions using an inflated balloon and observe how it moves or changes direction when pushed or pulled. They look for patterns in how the strength and direction of each force affects the balloon’s movement. They record their observations by completing cause and effect sentences and creating a labelled drawing with arrows to show the direction of the force.  

#### Flow  
1. Plain Text:  
   > With a classmate, use an inflated balloon to test your ideas.  
2. Two columns of fill-in-blanks:  
   - “I ___ so it moved.” — **Answer**: pushed / pulled (example answer: “pushed the balloon away from me”)  
   - “I ___ so it changed direction.” — **Answer**: pulled the balloon towards me  
3. Two columns of drawing:  
   - Draw what happened. Use an arrow to show the direction of the force.  
   - Draw what happened. Use an arrow to show the direction of the force.

## 6. Stopping Objects  
**Section** BALEekHgobzK (Teacher) | Duration: 5 min  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion. They apply this idea to understand how a ball or bike can be stopped, or how balloons can be held in place to keep them from moving.  

### Flow  
1. Statement Box:  
   > A push or a pull can make an object **stop** moving too.  
2. Discussion Prompt (boxed):  
   > How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?  
3. Show three images in columns with coloured labels beneath:  
   - Girl stopping a ball by pushing up under it. (Coloured Box: Stopping a ball)  
   - Girl on bike pulling brakes. (Stopping a bike)  
   - Child holding balloon string down. (Stopping balloons from flying away)  

### Answers (Fixed)  
**Stopping with a push**  
- Go-karts are stopped when the driver pushes the brake pedal.  
- The goalkeeper pushes the ball away.  
- The child on the slide uses her feet to push up to standing to stop herself.  

**Stopping with a pull**  
- The barking dog is held still by pulling on its lead.  
- The kite is stopped from flying away by pulling the string.  
- The sailboat’s movement is controlled by pulling the rope.

### 7a. Tug-of-War Questions  
**Section** X6SY1AXzqrfy (Student)  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students record their observations by answering the questions, showing how the size and strength of a force can affect an object's movement. Challenge students to physically test the idea of equal forces with a classmate by trying to keep a rope still.  

#### Flow  
1. Two columns (light blue):  
   - “How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn't move?”  
     - **Answer**: The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope did not move.  
   - “What needed to happen to make the rope move?”  
     - **Answer**: One side pulled harder than the other, making the forces unbalanced.  
2. Orange “Challenge” box:  
   > With a classmate, can you keep a rope still by using the same force from opposite sides?  
3. Two more columns (light blue):  
   - “How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?”  
     - **Answer**: The forces were unbalanced; one side pulled with greater force, causing movement.  
   - “What needed to happen to keep the rope still?”  
     - **Answer**: Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force.

## 8. Changing Direction with Goalie  
**Section** EMAjSYBZ3bK6 (Teacher) | Duration: 5 min  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce different results. They describe or demonstrate these possibilities to show their understanding of how a force can control the direction of a moving object.  

### Flow  
1. Statement Box:  
   > A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.  
2. Two-column layout: left for video, right for discussion.  
3. Show video (stimulusId: 19249) of a goalie diving to save a shot.  
4. Discussion Prompts (boxed):  
   - In what direction did the ball move?  
     - **Answer**: The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
   - How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?  
     - **Answer**: The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
   - Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?  
     - **Answer**: Yes; if the goalie kicked or pushed it at another angle, it would travel differently, or if caught it might bounce off in a new direction.

## 9. Push & Pull Sequences  
**Section** x9Nz1ofRKuTx (Student) | Duration: 10 min  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for it to work. Students consider examples like opening and closing a window and colouring with a crayon, drawing pictures with arrows to show the direction of force used in each case.  

### Flow  
1. Statement Box:  
   > Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for it to work.  
2. Plain Text:  
   > Draw a picture with arrows showing the direction of the forces for each example. Label the arrows with push or pull.  
3. Two columns:  
   - **Opening and closing a window** — students draw with arrows, label push/pull.  
   - **Using a crayon to colour in** — same.

### Answers (Examples)  
- Window: pull handle to open, push to close.  
- Crayon: push downward to colour, pull back to reposition.
