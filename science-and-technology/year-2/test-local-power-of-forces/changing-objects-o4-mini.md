**Lesson Link:** [www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects](www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects)  

**Focus Question**  
What can a push or a pull do?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  
**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  
**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  
**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

**Section ID:** X6SY1AXzqrfy  
**Components**  
1. Response  
   - _How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn't move?_  
2. Response  
   - _What needed to happen to make the rope move?_  
3. Coloured Box (Challenge)

   - _How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?_  
5. Response  
   - _What needed to happen to keep the rope still?_  

### Model Answers  
- When the rope didn’t move, forces were balanced—both sides pulled with equal strength.  
- To make the rope move, one side had to pull harder than the other (unbalanced forces).  
- To keep it still, both sides must pull with the same force.
