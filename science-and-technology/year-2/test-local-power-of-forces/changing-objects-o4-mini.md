## Teacher Reading (Teacher Knowledge)  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

*(Teaching Sequence “teacher-knowledge”)*

---

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

*(Teaching Sequence “note”)*

## Activity 4 (Section w – Teacher)

**Statement:**  
> A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.

**Video:** Short clip of a boy batting balls.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
1. **How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?**  
2. **How did the batter change the speed of the balls?**

*(Students respond by text, drawing or uploading an image.)*

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly.

*(Teaching Sequence for component CbPim460rqWw)*

**Teacher’s Guide – Suggested Answers:**  
1. One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
2. The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.

## Activity 5 (Section wV – Teacher)

**Statement:**  
> A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.

**Video:** Short clip of a soccer goalkeeper deflecting a ball.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
1. **In what direction did the ball move?**  
2. **How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?**  
3. **Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?**

*(Students respond by text, drawing or uploading an image.)*

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction, exploring how different types of forces can produce different results.

*(Teaching Sequence for component HcmCzTXmSjsM)*

**Teacher’s Guide – Suggested Answers:**  
1. The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
2. The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
3. Yes, if the goalie kicked or pushed the ball from another angle it would travel a different way, or if the goalie stopped it differently it might bounce off in a new direction. The goalie could also have caught the ball to stop it from moving completely.

**Discussion Prompt:**  
> How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?

**Images:**  
1. A girl in a warm coat and gloves plays with a red ball on a grassy, autumnal field. *(Stopping a ball)*  
2. A young girl rides a pink bicycle, smiling, wearing a helmet and bright clothing in a park. *(Stopping a bike)*  
3. Child in sunglasses joyfully holds a bunch of colourful balloons against a clear blue sky pulling them down using a string. *(Stopping balloons from flying away)*

*(Students respond by text, drawing or uploading an image.)*

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion. They apply this idea to understand how a ball or bike can be stopped, or how balloons can be held in place to keep them from moving.

*(Teaching Sequence for component JRcFgXzurioU)*

**Teacher’s Guide – Suggested Answer:**  
- The girl is about to catch the ball by pushing against the direction it’s moving in. This will cause the ball to stop.  
- To stop the bike, the rider pushes or pulls the brakes.  
- A child pulls the string down to stop the balloons from flying away.

## Activity 8 (Section yV – Teacher)

**Instruction:**  
Click on the interactive to play a game of *Tug-of-War* with some furry friends.

**Interactive:** Tug-of-War simulation.

**Instructions:**  
- Explore what happens when you drag dogs of different sizes to the left and right sides of the rope.  
- Press **Go** to see what happens to the rope.  
- Answer the questions on the next page.

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students play an interactive *Tug-of-War* game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope, connecting balanced and unbalanced forces to real-life examples. Encourage students to compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect the movement of the rope.

*(Teaching Sequence for component RZfBDMCAb5ey)*

---

### 8.1 Questions (Section yV V – Student)

1. **How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn’t move?**  
2. **What needed to happen to make the rope move?**  
3. **How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?**  
4. **What needed to happen to keep the rope still?**

**Teacher’s Guide – Suggested Answers:**  
1. The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope stayed in place.  
2. One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer balanced.  
3. The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope to move in that direction.  
4. Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced so the rope stayed in place.

> Sometimes an object needs a push and then a pull, or a pull and then a push, for it to work.

**Instruction:**  
Draw a picture with arrows showing the direction of the forces for each example. Label the arrows with **push** or **pull**.

1. Opening and closing a window  
2. Using a crayon to colour in

*(Drawing components aYsc3jqBs6zE and n4uCZCXidu27)*

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students consider how some objects need a push and a pull to work. They explore opening and closing a window and colouring with a crayon, drawing pictures with arrows to show the direction of force used in each example.

*(Teaching Sequence for component 3xxvBHfBSZuo)*

**Teacher’s Guide – Example Responses:**  
1. Students might illustrate pushing the window sash outwards to close, then pulling it inwards to open, labelling arrows accordingly.  
2. Students might draw colouring with a crayon where the hand pushes down to make a mark and pulls back to reposition, labelling arrows accordingly.
