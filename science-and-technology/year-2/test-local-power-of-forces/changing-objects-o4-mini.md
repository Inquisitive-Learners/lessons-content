## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object’s movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

### Activity 6 (5 min)  
**Changing Speed**  
**Teaching Note:**  
> Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly.

**Statement Box:**  
> A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object.  
> It can make it move faster or slower.

**Video:** short clip of a batter hitting balls.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
1. How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?  
2. How did the batter change the speed of the balls?  

**Suggested Answers:**  
1. One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
2. The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.

### Activity 7 (5 min)  
**Changing Direction**  
**Teaching Note:**  
> Students learn that a push or pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction and describe possibilities.

**Statement Box:**  
> A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.

**Video:** clip of a goalkeeper diving to catch a football.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
1. In what direction did the ball move?  
2. How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?  
3. Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?  

**Suggested Answers:**  
1. The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
2. The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
3. Yes—if the goalie kicked or pushed from another angle it would travel a different way, or if the goalie stopped it differently it might bounce off in a new direction. The goalie could also have caught the ball to stop it completely.

### Activity 10 (15 min)  
**Balloon Predictions**  
**Teaching Note:**  
> Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. They refine their thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner.

1. **Experiment:** With a classmate, use an inflated balloon to test your ideas.  
2. **Sentence 1:** Complete: “I ___ so it moved.”  
   - **Answer:** I **pushed the balloon against the floor** so it moved.  
3. **Sentence 2:** Complete: “I ___ so it changed direction.”  
   - **Answer:** I **pulled the balloon towards me** so it changed direction.  
4. **Draw:** What happened? Use an arrow to show force direction.

### Activity 12 (10 min)  
**Tug-of-War Interactive**  
**Teaching Note:**  
> Students play an interactive _Tug-of-War_ game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope, connecting equal and unequal forces to real-life examples. Encourage students to compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect rope movement.

**Instructions:**  
- Click to play the _Tug-of-War_ interactive.  
- Explore what happens when you drag dogs of different sizes to the left and right sides of the rope.  
- Press “Go” to see the rope’s reaction.

---

### Activity 13  
**Tug-of-War Reflection**  
**Teaching Note:**  
> Students record observations by answering questions, showing how force size and strength affect movement. Challenge them to test equal forces with a classmate.

**Questions & Answers:**  
1. **How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when it **didn’t** move?**  
   - The forces were balanced. Both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope did not move.  
2. **What needed to happen to make the rope move?**  
   - One side had to pull harder than the other side so the forces were no longer balanced.  
3. **How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope **did** move?**  
   - The forces were unbalanced. One side pulled with greater force, causing the rope to move that way.  
4. **What needed to happen to keep the rope still?**  
   - Both sides had to pull with the same amount of force, making the forces balanced so the rope stayed in place.
