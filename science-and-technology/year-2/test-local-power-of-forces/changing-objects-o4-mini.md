## Learning Intention  
Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. Vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Activity 4: Changing Speed (Explain)  
Duration: 5 minutes  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly.

**What’s being taught**  
- Stronger force → greater speed/distance.  
- Weaker force → slower movement.

**Materials & Setup**  
- Statement box: *“A push or a pull can change the speed of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.”*  
- A short video of bat hitting balls.  
- Discussion prompts:  
  1. *“How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?”*  
  2. *“How did the batter change the speed of the balls?”*

**Teacher Actions**  
1. Show statement box and play the video.  
2. Pause and ask first question, students discuss.  
3. Ask second question, collect responses.

**Exact Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They discuss how the strength of the push (the swing of the bat) affects speed.

**Expected Answers**  
1. One ball was only tapped so it barely moved. Another was hit a bit harder and went further. The strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
2. The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing. A gentle swing made the ball move slowly. A faster swing sent the ball speeding across the field.
