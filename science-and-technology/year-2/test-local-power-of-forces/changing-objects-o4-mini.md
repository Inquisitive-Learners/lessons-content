URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects

---

## Focus Question  
**What can a push or a pull do?**

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object’s movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

---

## Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words (low-frequency, subject-specific). Instruction should build content knowledge. These words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

---

## Introduction  
Show students the cover image and ask the focus question, **“What can a push or a pull do?”**  
Encourage them to share personal experiences (playing with balls, opening doors, using household objects) to explore how pushes and pulls cause things to move. Record responses to gauge prior understanding and identify misconceptions.

#### Sub-Activity 3.1 (Teacher Demonstration) – Experiment with Playdough

**Teaching Notes**  
Students physically shape playdough by pushing or pulling it. Guide them to experiment with different actions and notice how their technique influences the final shape.

**Instructions**  
- Push or pull the playdough to change its shape.  
- Record what your playdough looks like on the next page.  
- Complete the sentences using the words ‘push’ or ‘pull’.

**Demonstration**  
- Show image: *Child’s hands pulling bright yellow playdough into peaks.*  
- Speech bubble: **“I pull the playdough so it makes a mountain.”**

---

#### Sub-Activity 3.2 (Student Task) – Draw and Describe Playdough Changes

**Activity Flow**  
1. Two drawing frames side by side:  
   - Draw what your playdough looks like (before).  
   - Draw what your playdough looks like now (after).  
2. Complete: **“I ____ the playdough so it makes a ____.”**  
3. Complete: **“I ____ the playdough so it makes a ____.”**  

*(Student responses will vary.)*

### Activity 4 (5 min) – Change the Speed of a Ball

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance based on the strength of the push.

**Activity Flow**  
1. Statement box:  
   **“A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.”**  
2. Video: Boy batting balls (19216).  
3. Pose the questions:  
   - **How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?**  
   - **How did the batter change the speed of the balls?**  

**Answers**  
- A gentle tap barely moved the ball; a medium swing sent it further; the strongest hit sent it the farthest.  
- The batter varied the force of the swing—a harder swing made the ball move faster.

### Activity 5 (5 min) – Change the Direction of a Moving Object

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that a push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie and discuss how the force changed the ball’s path.

**Activity Flow**  
1. Statement box: **“A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.”**  
2. Video: Soccer goalie diving to catch a football (19249).  
3. Pose the questions:  
   - **In what direction did the ball move?**  
   - **How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?**  
   - **Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?**  

**Answers**  
- The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
- The goalie pushed the ball away with their hands, altering its path.  
- Yes—applying force at a different angle or catching it differently would send it in a new direction.

### Activity 6 (15 min) – Predicting Balloon Movement

**Teaching Notes**  
Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. They share and refine their predictions with a partner.

**Activity Flow**  
1. Statement box:  
   **“Objects can be moved forwards and backwards, up and down, and side to side. How much an object moves depends on the strength of the force used on it.”**  
2. Instruction: *With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.*  
3. Display balloon graphic with speech bubble **“Move me!”**  
4. Prompts:  
   - I can make the balloon move by …  
   - I can change the balloon’s direction by …  
   - I can make the balloon move faster by …  
   - I can stop the balloon from moving by …  

*(Students record their own predictions.)*
