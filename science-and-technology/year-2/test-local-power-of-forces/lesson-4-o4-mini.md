# Lesson: Science – Power of Forces (Magnets)

## Focus Question  
**What force can push or pull an object without touching it?**

---

## Learning Intention  
- Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Activity 1: Exploring Magnetic Toys (5 minutes)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.

1. Display the image of toys:  
   _Alt Text:_ A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set.
2. Ask:  
   - **What do they have in common?**  
     _Suggested Answer:_ They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.  
   - **How do these toys work?**  
     _Suggested Answer:_  
     - The magnetic fridge alphabet can be used to write messages or hold things in place on a fridge.  
     - The fishing game requires using a pole with a magnet on its end to fish out pieces.  
     - The magnetic tiles can be used to build new inventions.  
     - You can push and pull the toy train along a track; a magnet connects the carriages to each other.

## Activity 2: Classroom Magnet Hunt (10 minutes)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and predict which items will attract to the magnet.

**Instructions**  
Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.

**Table** (complete by students):

| Object | Material (What is it made of?) | Prediction (Will it attract?) | Observation (Did it attract?) |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|        |                               |                                |                               |
|        |                               |                                |                               |
|        |                               |                                |                               |
|        |                               |                                |                               |

**Statement**  
The toys all use magnets. A magnet can **pull** or **attract** an object so it sticks to it.

### Analysis Questions

**Teaching Notes**  
Students analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and think about what these materials have in common. They compare any unexpected outcomes and discuss whether those objects revealed something new about magnetism.

- **What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?**  
  _Suggested Answer:_ They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.

- **What did the magnets attract?**  
  _Suggested Answer:_ Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.

- **Were there any objects that surprised you?**  
  _Suggested Answers (examples):_  
  - I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.  
  - I was surprised my magnet attracted more than one object at a time.  
  - I was surprised my lunch box was not magnetic.  
  - I was surprised how strong my magnet was.

- **Did anything unusual happen with any objects?**  
  _Suggested Answers (examples):_  
  - My magnet picked up several things at once.  
  - My magnet attracted an object from a distance.  
  - Certain parts of my magnet had a stronger force than other parts.

## Activity 3: Investigating Magnetic Poles (10 minutes)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles, a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.

1. Explain:  
   > The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**. They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
   > Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.
2. In pairs, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.
3. Show the image:  
   _Alt Text:_ Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.

### Recording Observations

**Instructions**  
Complete the sentences and draw what happened.

| Poles Tested     | Sentence Completion                                                        | Drawing Prompt                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Opposite Poles   | I put a **north** pole and **south** pole together and they **attracted**.    | Draw and label what happened.  |
| Same Poles (NN)  | I put a **north** pole and **north** pole together and they **repelled**.     | Draw and label what happened.  |
| Same Poles (SS)  | I put a **south** pole and **south** pole together and they **repelled**.     | Draw and label what happened.  |

**Suggested Answers**  
- Opposite Poles: north, south, attracted.  
- Same Poles (N–N): north, north, repelled.  
- Same Poles (S–S): south, south, repelled.

## Activity 4: Magnetic Force over Distance (20 minutes)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.

1. Present the statement:  
   > “I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”
2. Ask:  
   - **Do you think this is possible?**  
     _Suggested Answer:_ Yes.  
   - **Explain your thinking.**  
     _Suggested Answer:_ If the magnet’s force is strong enough, I think the magnet will pull the paperclip without touching it because magnets can attract from a distance. A magnet’s force can be strong enough to attract an object through another non-magnetic material.
3. Show images:  
   - _Alt Text:_ A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.  
   - _Alt Text:_ Three speech bubbles in pink and purple, each featuring a large white question mark.

### Challenge: Magnet-guided Paper Clip

**Teaching Notes**  
Students are given the challenge of making a paper clip slide around a paper plate without the magnet touching it. Assist them to collect the materials they need and then carry out their investigation. Encourage experimentation with different approaches and to notice how changes in movement alter the paper clip’s direction. Guide them to also try using different parts of the magnet to see if the force is stronger in different places.

**Materials Needed**  
- A magnet  
- A metal paper clip  
- A paper plate  

**Try it!**

### Flowchart Reflection (10 minutes)

1. Draw, label and describe what you did using the flow chart:  
   _Alt Text:_ A flow chart labelled “First”, “Then”, “Next”, and “Finally”, with arrows between them.
2. Complete the sentence:  
   > “By doing this challenge, I discovered that a magnet …”  
   _Suggested Answer:_ “… can move metal objects through thin materials like paper or plastic without touching them.”
3. Present and share discoveries; consider creating a class fact wall on magnets.

## Activity 5: Maglev Train Model (20 minutes)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast and how their car moves.

1. Read the statement:  
   > A maglev is a special kind of train that uses **two sets of magnets** that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.
2. Show the image:  
   _Alt Text:_ A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.
3. Challenge:  
   **Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.**
4. Materials Needed:  
   - A toy car  
   - 2 magnets  
   - Sticky tape  
   - Road track  
   - (Image: Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.)

### Reflection

- Draw, label and describe what you did in a flow chart:  
  _Alt Text:_ A flowchart with four stages: First, Then, Next, and Finally, with arrows between sections.
- Complete the sentence:  
  > “By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets …”  
  _Suggested Answer:_ “… can work together to move another object without touching them.”

## Activity 6: The Magic of Magnets (20 minutes)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.

1. Read the statement:  
   > A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite. The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet. Many people thought that it had magic powers.
2. Ask:  
   **Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?**  
   _Suggested Answer:_ A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.
3. Show statement box and discuss.
4. Create Your Own Trick:  
   > Show how magnets can seem magical by creating your own magnet trick. Draw and label your trick below.
5. Try the trick on a classmate.
