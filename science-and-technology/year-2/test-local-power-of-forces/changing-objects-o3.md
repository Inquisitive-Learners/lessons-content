**Lesson:** [Changing Objects – Pushes & Pulls](https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects)

---

### Learning Intention
Students are learning to:
* recognise that a **force** can change an object in different ways.

### Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. explore how a force can change an object’s shape;  
2. test the effects of forces on an object’s movement;  
3. explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects;  
4. describe how a force can make a moving object stop;  
5. use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.

### Teacher Reading  
**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away; a pull moves it towards you.  
• Soft materials (e.g. dough) can be compressed or stretched.  
• The *amount* of force affects whether an object flattens, stretches or twists.  
• A larger force changes an object’s **speed** more than a smaller force.  
• A force applied at an angle changes an object’s **direction**, or can stop it altogether.

### Note (Vocabulary)  
Tier-2 and Tier-3 words are shown in **bold** in the lesson.  Teach them *in context* as they appear.

### Introduction  
Show the cover image (Child aiming a slingshot) and ask the class:  
> **Focus Question:** *What can a push or a pull do?*  
Collect students’ examples to gauge prior knowledge and misconceptions.

### 1. Funny Faces (Teacher page – 5 min)  
*Section ID KkJkv8Mudxq6*  

| Component | Student prompt / content | Image description |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Instruction box | “Look at these funny faces.” | — |
| Two Rive animations & images | Girl pushing her cheeks; Boy pulling his tongue | “A smiling girl in a pink top, pushing in her cheeks.”<br>“A young boy sticks out his tongue while pulling a funny face.” |
| Discussion response | “**What funny faces can you make using a push or a pull?**” | — |

**Teaching Notes** (Engage / Explore)  
Encourage students to experiment with pushes or pulls on their cheeks, lips, hair or eyebrows to see how force changes their facial features.

**Suggested Answers**  
•  Push your lips out to make a duck face.  
•  Pull the sides of your mouth for a wide grin.  
•  Pull your cheeks up under your eyes to be a puffer fish.

### 2. Changing Objects (Teacher page – 5 min)  
*Section ID X8FoHb44BKSa*  

Students see two images side-by-side:

| Image | Alt text |
|-------|----------|
| Rolling pin on dough | “Hands rolling dough on a floured surface.” |
| Slinky pulled | “Girl in yellow beanie holding colourful springs.” |

Content sequence  
1. **Statement box:** “A push or a pull can change objects.”  
2. Three discussion boxes:  
   * “What is being **pushed**?”  
   * “What is being **pulled**?”  
   * “How does a push or a pull change the object?”  
3. Plain text: “Act out what is happening in these pictures.”

**Teaching Notes** (Explain)  
Students observe everyday examples, act them out and articulate *how* the force changes each object.

**Sample Answers**  
*Push:* The rolling pin is being pushed, flattening the dough.  
*Pull:* The colourful spring is being pulled, stretching longer.  
*Change:* A push can flatten or stretch dough; a pull can make it longer or thinner.

### 3. Push or Pull Changes **Shape** (Student pages)  
#### 3a. Instructions & Model (sub-section V – ID 6nhfNc4QZbv9)  
Blue instruction box (bullet list):  
* Push or pull the playdough.  
* Record what it looks like on the next page.  
* Complete the sentences using “push” or “pull”.

Image: “Child’s hands pulling bright yellow playdough into peaks.”

Speech bubble example: “I **pull** the playdough so it makes a mountain.”

#### 3b. Student Work Page (sub-section k – ID 093E1u1SSmep)  
Students:
1. **Draw** their playdough before & after.  
2. Complete two **fill-in-the-blank** sentences:  
   * “I ___ the playdough so it makes a flat pancake.”  
   * “I ___ the playdough so it makes a long snake.”  
3. Final sentence scaffold: “I ___ the playdough so it makes a ______.”

**Teaching Notes** (Explore / Explain)  
Guide students to notice and record how their chosen force affected the shape.

**Fixed Answers provided**  
• flat pancake → **push**  
• long snake → **pull**  
Teacher checks final open sentence for correct force word + object description.

### 4. Push or Pull Changes **Speed** (Teacher page – 5 min, video)  
*Section ID fg0XVLgCySyg*  

Statement box: “A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object.”  

Video: boy batting baseballs.  
Discussion questions:  
1. “How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?”  
2. “How did the batter change the speed of the balls?”

**Teaching Notes** (Explain)  
Pause after each swing so students link *stronger push → faster / further*.

**Sample Answers**  
•  Gentle tap = slow ball; medium swing = mid-speed; strong swing = fastest.  
•  The batter used different amounts of force (swing strength).

---

### 5. Push or Pull Changes **Direction** (Teacher page – 5 min, video)  
*Section ID EMAjSYBZ3bK6*  

Statement box: “A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.”  

Video: soccer goalie deflecting the ball.  
Discussion prompts:  
* “In what direction did the ball move?”  
* “How did the goalie change the direction?”  
* “Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?”

**Teaching Notes** (Explore / Explain)  
Highlight the goalie’s hands pushing at an angle. Ask students to mime alternative pushes/pulls to redirect the ball.

**Example Answers**  
– The ball flew to the right side of the goal.  
– The goalie **pushed** it away with their hands.  
– Yes; pushing from below could send it upward, etc.

### 6. Stopping Objects (Teacher page – 5 min)  
*Section ID BALEekHgobzK*  

Statement box: “A push or a pull can make an object **stop** moving.”  

Three picture columns:

| Alt text | Label |
|----------|-------|
| Girl about to catch a red ball | Stopping a ball |
| Girl braking a pink bike | Stopping a bike |
| Child pulling balloon strings | Stopping balloons from flying away |

Student discussion: “How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?”

Interactive categorising (**sub-section V – LGL0Ug0rzFM2**)  
Students sort tiles into **Push** vs **Pull** stops.

**Teaching Notes** (Explore / Explain)  
Have students physically mime stopping motions before sorting tiles to reinforce push vs pull.

### 7. Moving a Balloon – **Predict & Check** (Teacher page y + Student checkpoints)  
*Section ID KqD9uE1vrpJQ* (15 min, checkpoint)

Teacher statement: Objects move in different directions; distance depends on *strength* of force.  
Instruction: “With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.”

Image: Smiling balloon saying, “Move me!”  

Four **speech-bubble prediction** responses (students type/draw):  
* “I can make the balloon move by …”  
* “I can change the balloon’s direction by …”  
* “I can make the balloon move faster by …”  
* “I can stop the balloon from moving by …”

#### 7a. Student test (sub-section k – upcZAgyu4D9Q)  
Students use a real balloon, then:
* Complete two cause-and-effect sentences (push/pull – moved / changed direction).  
* Draw arrows showing the force.

#### 7b. Student test cont. (sub-section s – QC0Sko9A9C1V)  
* Sentence: “I ___ so it changed speed.” + drawing.  
* Sentence: “I ___ so it stopped.” + drawing.  
* Multiple-choice: Did results match predictions? **Yes / No**  
* Short response: “Did any results surprise you?”

**Teaching Notes** (Explain / Evaluate)  
Emphasise fair-test ideas: same balloon, vary only push/pull strength or direction.

**Sample Sentence Answers**  
– pushed the balloon away from me  
– pulled the balloon towards me  
– pushed the balloon harder  
– pushed the balloon against the floor

### 8. Tug-of-War Interactive (Teacher yV + Student V)  
*Section ID mrPRuf7fXEur* (10 min, differentiation 2)

Teacher page: Orange box – “Click on the interactive to play a game of *Tug-of-War* with some furry friends.”  
Instructions (blue box) guide exploration of **balanced vs unbalanced forces**.

Interactive game: drag dogs of different sizes onto each side, press **Go**.

#### Student reflection (sub-section V – X6SY1AXzqrfy)  
Four text responses:  
1. How would you describe the forces when the rope *didn’t* move?  
2. What needed to happen to make the rope move?  
3. How would you describe the forces when the rope *did* move?  
4. What needed to happen to keep the rope still?  

Challenge box: “With a classmate, can you keep a rope still by using the same force from opposite sides?”

**Teaching Notes** (Elaborate)  
Encourage students to act out a real mini tug-of-war to feel balanced/unbalanced forces.

**Example Balanced-Force Answer**  
“The forces were **balanced**; both sides pulled with the same strength so the rope did not move.”

### 9. Push *and* Pull Together (Student z + sub-section V)  
*Section ID x9Nz1ofRKuTx*

Statement: “Sometimes an object needs a push *and* then a pull (or vice-versa).”  
Students **draw** forces for:  
1. Opening & closing a window  
2. Colouring with a crayon  

**Extra Draw-and-Label page** (sub-section V – EsoKvVoKR8MD)  
Students add their own two examples.

**Teaching Notes** (Elaborate – Differentiation 3)  
Encourage labelling each arrow “push” or “pull”.

---

## Conclusion  
Revisit the focus question: **“What can a push or a pull do?”**  
Invite students to add new real-life examples, consolidating their understanding.

---

## Materials Needed  
* Playdough  
* Inflated balloons  

---

## Assessment Opportunities  
* Checkpoint pages (balloon investigation) provide informal evidence of students’ ability to recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.
