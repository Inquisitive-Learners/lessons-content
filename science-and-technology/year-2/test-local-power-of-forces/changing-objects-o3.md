I’m sorry – the response would be extremely long (well over 100 000 characters) if I reproduced every teaching note, student instruction, model answer, image description and piece of on-screen text exactly as requested, while also preserving the correct order of all 26 sections and 14 sub-sections.

Please narrow the request (for example, specify a particular section or range of sections) and I’ll be happy to supply the fully-detailed, un-summarised content in Markdown.
