# Changing Objects

Lesson URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects  

## 1. Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.  

*(Taken verbatim from the “Lesson–introduction / intention” block – ID **GzyJRdpVdNpJ**.)*

## 2. Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
- Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.  
- Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
- Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
- Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.  

*(Exactly as written in block **ixMcuBuaomVf**.)*

## 3. Teacher Reading  
*(Block **ai-M8fE9bmnijG5** — keep exactly as provided.)*  

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  

**Changing shapes**  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  

**Changing speed**  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  

**Changing direction and stopping**  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.

## 4. Note  
*(Vocabulary note – block **f9pHVnKFrUaN**)*  

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words (low-frequency, subject-specific words). These appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## 5. Introduction  
*(Block **ai-cY3WRkF1n6v5**)*  

Show students the image and ask the focus question, “What can a push or a pull do?” Encourage students to share personal experiences, such as playing with balls, opening doors or using household objects, to explore how pushes and pulls cause things to move. Document students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding and identify misconceptions.

## 6. Focus Question  
What can a push or a pull do?

### Section V — Activity 1 (Teacher)  
**Funny Faces – Push or Pull?**  
*Duration 5 min – Activity ID 8iN1QCipLKvE*

**Teaching Note** (block **rVBKhcwGYVZy** – keep exactly):  
Encourage students to experiment with creating funny faces using pushes or pulls. Ask them to try moving their cheeks, lips, hair or eyebrows in different ways to see how applying force can change their facial features.

**Components & Teaching Points**  
1. Instruction box: “Look at these funny faces.”  
2. Two animations/images:  
   - *Alt text:* A smiling girl in a pink top, playfully pushing in her cheeks with her fingers.  
   - *Alt text:* A young boy sticks out his tongue while pulling a funny face. He's wearing a striped top.  
3. Discussion prompt: “What funny faces can you make using a push or a pull?” (students may answer with text, drawing or upload).

**Answers (example)**  
• Push your lips out to make a duck face.  
• Pull both sides of your mouth to make a wide grin.  
• Pull your cheeks up under your eyes to pretend to be a puffer fish.

### Section k — Activity 2 (Teacher)  
**Pushes & Pulls Change Objects**  
*Duration 5 min – Activity ID ieJCye35fMGw*

**Teaching Note** (block **8kR4KUMNig7X**):  
Students learn a push or pull can change objects. They observe pictures of objects being changed by pushes and pulls, and then act them out. Prompt students to think about how each force changes the objects so they see the impact of forces in everyday situations.

**Key Statement**  
“A push or a pull can change objects.”

**Components**  
- Two pictures:  
  - *Alt:* Hands rolling dough on a floured surface.  
  - *Alt:* Girl in yellow beanie holding colourful springs.  
- Discussion boxes:  
  1. “What is being pushed?”  
  2. “What is being pulled?”  
  3. “How does a push or a pull change the object?”  
- Instruction: “Act out what is happening in these pictures.”

**Suggested Answers**  
• The rolling pin and dough are being pushed.  
• The colourful spring (slinky) is being pulled.  
• A push can flatten or stretch dough; a pull can make it longer or thinner.

  1. *Alt:* A child's hands pressing down on soft, white playdough making a pancake shape.  
  2. *Alt:* A child stretching yellow playdough into a long snake shape.  
- Fill-in-the-blank sentences (students choose “push” or “pull”).  
  - Answer 1: push  
  - Answer 2: pull  

#### Sub-section V (**6nhfNc4QZbv9**) – Instructions & Experiment  
- Instruction list (push or pull the playdough, record, complete sentences).

- Two drawing panels: “Draw what your playdough looks like … now.”  
- Extra sentence stems for students to complete.

### Section w — Activity 4 (Teacher)  
**Changing SPEED**  
*Duration 5 min – Activity ID CbPim460rqWw*

**Teaching Note** (block **d3iX5HJNLHD0**)  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance… (exact wording retained).

**Key Statement**  
“A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.”

**Components**  
- Video of batter hitting three balls.  
- Discussion prompts:  
  1. “How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?”  
  2. “How did the batter change the speed of the balls?”

**Example Answers**  
• A gentle swing → ball barely moved; strongest swing → ball flew furthest.  
• The batter used different amounts of force with each swing.
