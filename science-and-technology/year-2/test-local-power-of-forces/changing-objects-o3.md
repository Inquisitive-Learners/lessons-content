# Changing objects  
Lesson page: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6281-changing-objects  

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Recognise that a force can change an object in different ways.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
• Explore how a force can change an object’s shape.  
• Test the effects of forces on an object's movement.  
• Explain how forces change the speed and direction of objects.  
• Understand that a force can be used to make a moving object stop.  
• Use scientific vocabulary in compound sentences to describe the effect of forces on objects.  

## Teacher Reading  
Pushes and pulls  
A push is a force that moves an object away from you. A pull moves an object towards you.  

Changing shapes  
Pushes and pulls can compress or stretch soft materials like dough or clay, changing their shape. The amount of force applied determines whether the object flattens, stretches or twists.  

Changing speed  
Objects move faster or slower based on how much force is used. A small push or pull causes gentle movement. A stronger force speeds up the object more quickly.  

Changing direction and stopping  
Applying force to a moving object at an angle changes its direction. A push or pull against its motion can cause it to stop.  

## Note  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Focus Question  
*What can a push or a pull do?*  

## Introduction (whole-class)  
Show students the cover image (alt text: “Child in a cap aiming a wooden slingshot, squinting with focus against a blurred background.”) and ask the focus question above. Encourage students to share personal experiences such as playing with balls, opening doors or using household objects to explore how pushes and pulls cause things to move. Document students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and identify any misconceptions.

### 1. Funny Faces  (Teacher page V)  
**Images**  
• “A smiling girl in a pink top, playfully pushing in her cheeks with her fingers.”  
• “A young boy sticks out his tongue while pulling a funny face. He's wearing a striped top.”  

**Student prompt**  
Instruction box: “Look at these funny faces.”  
Discussion: “What funny faces can you make using a push or a pull?”  

**Teaching Note**  
Encourage students to experiment with creating funny faces using pushes or pulls. Ask them to try moving their cheeks, lips, hair or eyebrows in different ways to see how applying force can change their facial features.  

**Expected answers (examples)**  
• Push your lips out to make a duck face.  
• Pull both sides of your mouth to make a wide grin.  
• Pull your cheeks up under your eyes to pretend to be a puffer fish.

### 2. Pushes & Pulls Change Objects  (Teacher page k)  
**Statement box** – “A push or a pull can change objects.”  

**Images**  
• “Hands rolling dough on a floured surface, preparing for baking.”  
• “Girl with long hair in a yellow beanie poses against a yellow background, holding colourful springs.”  

**Student prompts**  
1. “What is being pushed?”  
2. “What is being pulled?”  
3. “How does a push or a pull change the object?”  
Instruction: “Act out what is happening in these pictures.”  

**Teaching Note**  
Students learn a push or pull can change objects. They observe pictures of objects being changed by pushes and pulls, and then act them out. Prompt students to think about how each force changes the objects so they see the impact of forces in everyday situations.  

**Example answers**  
• The rolling pin is being pushed back and forth.  
• The colourful spiral spring is being pulled by the girl.  
• A push can flatten or stretch dough; a pull can make it longer or thinner.

### 3. Changing Shape with Playdough  (Teacher page s)  

#### 3a. Statement (Teacher page s)  
Statement box – “A push or a pull can change the **shape** of an object.”  

#### 3b. Sub-section V – Instructions & modelling (student view)  
**Instruction box**  
• Push or pull the playdough to change its shape.  
• Record what your playdough looks like on the next page.    
• Complete the sentences using the words ‘push’ or ‘pull’.  

**Image** – “Child's hands pulling bright yellow playdough into peaks.” (alt text)  
Speech bubble example: “I pull the playdough so it makes a mountain.”  
Plain text: “Experiment with playdough.”  

**Teaching Note**  
Students learn that a push or a pull can change the shape of an object. They read and complete sentences describing how a push or pull can change an object’s shape.  

#### 3c. Sub-section k – Student recording page  
Draw prompts  
• “Draw what your playdough looks like.”  
• “Draw what your playdough looks like now.”  

Sentence completions

### 4. Changing Speed  (Teacher page w)  
Statement box – “A push or a pull can change the **speed** of an object. It can make it move faster or slower.”  

**Video** – Boy batting baseballs (no audio description)  

**Student prompts**  
• “How strong was the force of the bat on each ball? How do you know?”  
• “How did the batter change the  speed of the balls?”  

**Teaching Note**  
Students learn that a push or pull can change the speed of an object. They watch a short video of a boy batting balls and notice that each ball travels a different distance. They observe how the strength of the push (the swing of the bat) affects how far and fast the ball moves. Students discuss how a bigger push makes the ball move faster and go further, and how a smaller push makes it move more slowly. They explain how the batter changed the speed of the balls by using different amounts of force.  

**Example answers**  
• One ball was only tapped so it barely moved; another was hit a bit harder; the strongest hit sent the ball flying the greatest distance.  
• The batter swung the bat at different speeds, applying different strength to each swing.

### 5. Changing Direction  (Teacher page wV)  
Statement box – “A push or a pull can change the **direction** of a moving object.”  

**Video** – Soccer goalie saving a ball.  

**Student prompts**  
1. “In what direction did the ball move?”  
2. “How did the goalie change the direction of the ball?”  
3. “Could the ball have moved in a different direction? How?”  

**Teaching Note**  
Students learn that a push or a pull can change the direction of a moving object. They watch a short video of a soccer goalie, observing how the goalie’s hands push the ball and change its direction. Students imagine other ways the ball could change direction.  

**Example answers**  
• The ball went flying off to the side of the goal.  
• The goalie used their hands to push the ball away, causing it to move away from the goal.  
• Yes – kicking or pushing from another angle would send it a different way, or catching it would stop it completely.

### 6. Stopping Objects  (Teacher page x)  

Statement box – “A push or a pull can make an object **stop** moving too.”  

**Images & labels**  
• “A girl in a warm coat and gloves plays with a red ball…” – label *Stopping a ball*  
• “A young girl rides a pink bicycle…” – label *Stopping a bike*  
• “Child in sunglasses joyfully holds a bunch of colourful balloons…” – label *Stopping balloons from flying away*  

**Student prompt**  
“How is a push or a pull used in the pictures to stop things from moving?”  

**Teaching Note**  
Students explore how objects can be stopped by using a push or a pull. Using the provided examples, they think about how force can work against motion.  

**Example answers**  
• The girl is about to catch the ball by **pushing** against its motion.  
• The bike stops when the rider **pulls** the brake levers.  
• The balloons are held down by **pulling** the string.

Instruction box – “With a classmate, predict how you might complete each sentence.”  

**Image** – “A smiling red balloon with big eyes says, ‘Move me!’”  

Student sentence starters (speech bubbles):  
• “I can make the balloon move by …”  
• “I can change the balloon’s direction by …”  
• “I can make the balloon move faster by …”  
• “I can stop the balloon from moving by ...”  

**Teaching Note**  
Students predict how to move a balloon in different ways, focusing on how a push or pull changes its position, direction and speed. Students refine their thinking by sharing their ideas with a partner.  

*(Checkpoint: students’ ideas captured for assessment – no fixed answers.)*

• Answer the questions on the next page.  

**Teaching Note**  
Students play an interactive **Tug-of-War** game by dragging dogs of different sizes to each side of a virtual rope, connecting equal and unequal forces to real-life examples. Encourage students to compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect the movement of the rope.  

#### 8a. Sub-section V – Student reflection  
Open responses:  
• “How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope didn't move?” – *The forces were balanced…*  
• “What needed to happen to make the rope move?” – *One side had to pull harder…*  
• “How would you describe the forces on each side of the rope when the rope moved?” – *The forces were unbalanced…*  
• “What needed to happen to keep the rope still?” – *Both sides had to pull with the same force.*  

Challenge box: “With a classmate, can you keep a rope still by using the same  force from opposite sides?”
