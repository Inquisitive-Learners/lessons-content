## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
* Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
* Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
* Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
* Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.  

## Teacher Reading  
Magnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt) respond to a magnetic force, while materials such as plastic, wood or paper do not.  
Each magnet has two poles.  Like poles repel; opposite poles attract.  
Magnetic force is a non-contact force – it can push or pull without touching the object.  
Magnets are found in many everyday objects (toys, compasses, door latches, etc.).  

## Note  
**Vocabulary words** in this lesson are Tier 2 and Tier 3 words that appear in **bold** in the student pages.  Teach them in context to build content knowledge.  

## Introduction  
Show the landscape image (alt text: *A smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear.*) and ask:  

> What force can push or pull an object without touching it?  

Encourage children to share any experiences where things seem to move “by magic”. Record ideas and misconceptions for later.  

## Focus Question  
*What force can push or pull an object without touching it?*

## Activity 1 – Exploring magnetic toys  (Teacher page)  
Image alt text: *A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set.*  

Teaching note (uZkhKzJ4Zuno):  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them.  Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.  

Class discussion prompts (displayed exactly as on the student page):  
1. **“What do they have in common?”**  
2. **“How do these toys work?”**

Suggested answers  
* They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.  
* Fridge letters stick to the fridge; the fishing pole lifts fish; magnetic tiles snap together; the train carriages couple with magnets.

## Activity 2 – Magnet object hunt  
### 2A. Predict and test (Student page “okRZPyVN7yy9”)  

Teaching note (cecidykKLW3Y):  
Students learn that a magnet can **pull** or **attract** an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.  

Student instructions (exact wording):  
*“Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.”*  
*“Complete the table.”*  

The table headings are: **Object | Material | Prediction | Observation**  

Statement box for teacher to reinforce:  
*The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it.*  

### 2B. Discuss the results (Teacher subsection “kzmMGYVr8Dsx”)  

Teaching note (08cgRoeFCsNg):  
Students analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and think about what these materials have in common.  They compare any unexpected outcomes and discuss whether those objects revealed something new about magnetism.  

Prompt questions (exact wording):  
* “What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?”  
* “What did the magnets attract?”  
* “Were there any objects that surprised you?”  
* “Did anything unusual happen with any objects?”  
* “Discuss your object hunt with the class.”  

Image alt text: *A joyful child holding a magnet, with a colourful educational map in the background.*  

Suggested answers  
* Attracted objects were mostly metal (steel paperclips, pins, lids).  
* My magnet attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
* Surprises might include desk legs, some coins, or the strength of the magnet attracting several objects at once.

## Activity 3 – Magnet poles: attract or repel?  
### 3A. Investigate poles (Teacher page “V814N2svNRqM”)  

Teaching note (GRsoqoaK489y):  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.  

Statement box (exact wording):  
*The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**.  
They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
Magnets can also **attract** or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.*  

Student task:  
*“With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.”*  

Image alt text: *Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.*  

### 3B. Record findings (Student subsection “tXv0jarCYgkE”)  

Teaching note (uysLdAmERhrU):  
Students draw, label and complete sentences describing what happened when they put like and unlike poles together.  

Components for each pair of magnets:  
1. Fill-in-the-blank sentence:  
   “I put a ____ pole and ____ pole together and they ____.”  
2. Draw and label what happened.  
   Coloured word boxes supplied: **north**, **south**, **attracted**, **repelled**  

Suggested answers  
* north + south → attracted  
* north + north → repelled  
* south + south → repelled  

(images of attraction / repulsion are provided for students in the suggested answers set)

## Activity 4 – Can a magnet move a paper clip without touching it?  
### 4A. Predict (Teacher page “5jL5o62jDbWX”)  

Teaching note (pa0tvwvj9Fkm):  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about magnetic forces acting over a distance.  

Speech-bubble prompt shown to class:  
*“I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”*  

Discussion questions:  
* “Do you think this is possible?”  
* “Explain your thinking.”  

Suggested answers (examples)  
* Yes – a magnet’s force can attract through thin materials like paper or plastic.  

Image alt text: *A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.*  

### 4B. Practical challenge  (Teacher subsection “m2MFrKkGR8AX”)  

Teaching note (sf8HjtzjsAsS):  
Students are given the challenge of making a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it. Assist them to collect the materials they need and then carry out their investigation.  

Challenge box (exact wording):  
*“Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.”*  

Materials list (exact wording):  
* A magnet  
* A metal paper clip

## Activity 5 – Maglev inspiration: moving a toy car with magnets  
### 5A. Explore the idea (Teacher page “8MGq7GU72SLA”)  

Teaching note (Ua25Hm07Rjqy):  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to consider magnet positioning and polarity.  

Statement box text:  
*A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it …*  

Image alt text: *A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.*  

### 5B. Carry out the challenge (Student subsection “Fm3Xj3nGJSXd”)  

Challenge box (exact wording):  
*“Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.”*  

Materials (exact wording):  
* A toy car  
* 2 magnets  
* Sticky tape  
* Road track  

Image alt text: *Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.*  

Student tasks:  
1. Draw, label and describe the steps in the four-stage flow-chart.

## Activity 6 – The “magic” of magnets  
(Student page “U4ByHnVMxfoR”)  

Teaching note (VsdoXkw2TsKF):  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick and perform it for the class.  

Story statement (exact wording):  
*A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite… Many people thought that it had magic powers.*  

Student tasks:  
1. Written response: *“Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?”*  
2. Draw and label your own magnet trick that seems magical.  
3. Coloured box prompt: *“Try the trick on a classmate.”*  

Suggested answer example  
* A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.
