# Lesson: [Magnetic Forces](https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6283-magnetic-forces)

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
2. Recognise that magnets have a **north pole** and a **south pole** that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
3. Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
4. Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.  

## Teacher Reading  
Magnetic materials  
• Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.  

Poles  
• Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they **repel**, whereas opposite poles **attract**.  

Non-contact force  
• Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.  

Common uses  
• Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact.  

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the landscape image (alt text: *“A smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear.”*) and ask:  

> What force can push or pull an object without touching it?

Encourage students to share any experiences or objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Document their responses to gauge current understanding and identify misconceptions.

### Focus Question  
What force can push or pull an object without touching it?

## Activity 1 – Toy Investigation (Teacher page)  
**Duration:** 5 min  
**Teaching Notes (Explore & Engage)**  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.

### Student Prompts  
1. “**What do they have in common?**”  
   *Answer:* They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.  
2. “**How do these toys work?**”  
   *Answer:*  
   • The magnetic fridge alphabet can be used to write messages on the fridge or to hold things in place on a fridge.  
   • The fishing game requires the player to use a pole with a magnet on its end to fish out the pieces.  
   • The magnetic tiles can be used to build new inventions.  
   • You can push and pull the toy train along a track or on a surface. A magnet connects the carriages to each other.

### 2a. Object Hunt (Student page)  
**Duration:** 10 min  

Instruction box  
“Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.”

Students complete the table:

| Object | Material – What is it made of? | Prediction – Will it attract to the magnet? | Observation – Did it attract to the magnet? |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

Statement box (purple border)  
“The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it.”

**Teaching Notes (Explain & Engage)**  
Students learn that a magnet can attract an object so it sticks to it. They test objects in the classroom and record their findings. Encourage students to predict which items will attract to the magnet.

### 2b. Class Discussion (Teacher page – subsection)  
**Teaching Notes**  
Students analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and note what they have in common. They discuss unexpected outcomes.

Discussion questions (exact wording):  
1. “**What type of materials  were the attracted objects made from?**”  
   *Answer:* They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.  
2. “**What did the magnets attract?**”  
   *Answer:* Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
3. “**Were there any objects that surprised you?**”  
   *Example answers:* • I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic. • …  
4. “**Did anything unusual happen with any objects?**”  
   *Example answers:* • My magnet picked up several things at once. • My magnet attracted an object from a distance.  

Image (alt text): *“A joyful child holding a magnet, with a colourful educational map in the background.”*

Speech bubble (grey):  
“I noticed that my magnet could attract more than one object at a time.”

## Activity 3 – Magnetic Poles  
### 3a. Teacher Input (Teacher page)  
**Duration:** 10 min  
Statement box  
“The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**. They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.”

Instruction text  
“With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.”

Image (alt text): *“Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.”*

**Teaching Notes (Explain)**  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles. They test like and unlike poles to observe attraction or repulsion.

### 3b. Student Recording (Student page – subsection)  
Students work in three columns with the following exact instructions shown beside each task:

1. Fill-in-the-blank sentence  
   “Complete the sentence.”  
   Sentence scaffold:  
   *I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.*  
   • Possible answer set 1: north / south / attracted  
   • Possible answer set 2: north / north / repelled  
   • Possible answer set 3: south / south / repelled  

2. Draw task (three boxes)  
   “Draw and label what happened.”

3. Vocabulary support  
   Coloured boxes show the words: **north**, **south**, **repelled**, **attracted**.

## Activity 5 – Maglev Car Investigation  
### 5a. Teacher Input (Teacher page)  
**Duration:** 20 min  
Statement box  
“A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.”

Image (alt text): *“A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.”*

Columns:  
• Purple “Challenge” box – “Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.”  
• Blue “Materials” box – lists: A toy car; 2 magnets; Sticky tape; Road track.  
• Image (alt text): *“Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.”*

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
Students recreate the idea of maglev by using repelling / attracting magnets to move a toy car. Encourage them to test positioning and polarity.

### 5b. Student Recording (Student page – subsection)  
Draw task: flow-chart template (First / Then / Next / Finally).  
Instruction: “Draw, label and describe what you did.”  

Response prompt  
“By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets …”  
Example answer: “… can work together to move another object without touching them.”

**Teaching Notes**  
Students draw and label a flow chart to explain how they moved the car, noting which poles were used and how positioning helped.

## Activity 6 – Magnetic “Magic” Trick (Student page)  
**Duration:** 20 min  

Statement box  
“A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite.  
The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet.  
Many people thought that it had magic powers.”

Columns:  
1. Response prompt  
   “Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?”  
   Example answer: *A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.*  

2. Draw task  
   “Show how magnets can seem magical by creating your own magnet trick. Draw and label your trick below.”  

Blue box  
“Try the trick on a classmate.”

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
Students explore why people once thought magnets were magical and create their own “magic” trick using magnetic force, performing it for classmates.
