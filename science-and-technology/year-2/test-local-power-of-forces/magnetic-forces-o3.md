# Lesson Overview – Magnetic Forces  
URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6283-magnetic-forces  

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson students will be able to:  
1. Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
2. Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
3. Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
4. Create a flow-chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.  

## Teacher Reading  
Magnetic materials – Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.  

Poles – Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.  

Non-contact force – Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.  

Common uses – Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.  

## Note (Vocabulary)  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the landscape image (alt text: *A smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear.*) and ask:  
“What force can push or pull an object without touching it?”  
Encourage students to share experiences of objects that move without being touched. Record their ideas to gauge current understanding.

## Focus Question  
What force can push or pull an object without touching it?

## 1. Magnetic Toy Mystery (Section VyTF0GATjpnH – Teacher) – 5 min  

**Image** – alt text: *A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set.*

### Student Prompts  
1. “What do they have in common?”  
2. “How do these toys work?”

### Teaching Notes  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.

### Answers  
• They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.  
• Examples:  
  – The fridge alphabet sticks to the fridge.  
  – The fishing game uses a magnet on the pole.  
  – Magnetic tiles click together to build.  
  – The toy train carriages are joined with magnets.

## 2. Magnet Object Hunt (Section okRZPyVN7yy9 – Student) – 10 min  
### Instruction to Students  
“Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.” Complete the table provided.

(The editable table contains the headings **Object | Material | Prediction | Observation**.)

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.

### 2a. Object-Hunt Discussion (Sub-section kzmMGYVr8Dsx – Teacher)  
**Image** – alt text: *A joyful child holding a magnet, with a colourful educational map in the background.*

#### Discussion Prompts  
• “What did the magnets attract?”  
• “What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?”  
• “Were there any objects that surprised you?”  
• “Did anything unusual happen with any objects?”  
> Discuss your object hunt with the class.

#### Teaching Notes  
Students now analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and think about what these materials have in common. They compare any unexpected outcomes and discuss whether those objects revealed something new about magnetism.

#### Answers (examples)  
• Magnets attracted objects that contained metal, such as steel pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
• Attracted objects were mostly made from metal.  
• Surprises might include desk legs or coins being magnetic, or magnets lifting several objects at once.  
• Some magnets attracted more than one object at a time or had stronger force at their ends.

## 3. Poles – Attract or Repel? (Section V814N2svNRqM – Teacher) – 10 min  

**Statement Box**  
The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**. They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**. Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.

### Teacher Direction  
“With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.”

**Image** – alt text: *Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.*

### Teaching Notes  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.

---

### 3a. Record & Draw (Sub-section tXv0jarCYgkE – Student)  
Students complete three “fill-in-the-blank” sentences and three labelled drawings to show what happened with different pole combinations.  
Colour word boxes supplied: **north**, **south**, **repelled**, **attracted**.

#### Answers (model)  
Sentence 1: I put a **north** pole and **south** pole together and they **attracted**.  
Sentence 2: I put a **north** pole and **north** pole together and they **repelled**.  
Sentence 3: I put a **south** pole and **south** pole together and they **repelled**.

## 4. Can You Move a Paper Clip Without Touching It? (Section 5jL5o62jDbWX – Teacher – Checkpoint) – 20 min  

**Speech Bubble** – “I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”  
**Image** – alt text: *A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.*  
**Checkpoint** – formative assessment opportunity.

### Discussion Prompts  
• “Do you think this is possible?”  
• “Explain your thinking.”

### Teaching Notes  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.

### Answers (examples)  
Yes. A magnet’s force can attract an object through thin materials like paper or plastic without touching it because magnets exert a force over a distance.

#### 4a. Teacher Challenge Brief (Sub-section m2MFrKkGR8AX – Teacher)  
**Coloured Box – Challenge**  
“Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.”  

**Instruction Box – Materials**  
• A magnet  
• A metal paper clip  
• A paper plate  

**Image** – alt text: *A red and grey magnet, a paperclip, and a white plate on a light blue background.*  
**Coloured Box** – “Try it!”

##### Teaching Notes  
Students are given the challenge. Assist them to collect materials and carry out their investigation. Encourage experimentation: different positions, movements and parts of the magnet.

---

#### 4b. Student Recording (Sub-section tWREJXamRyc5 – Student)  
Students complete a four-part flow chart (image alt text: *A flow chart labelled 'First', 'Then', 'Next', and 'Finally', with arrows between them.*) to draw, label and describe what they did, then finish:  
“By doing this challenge, I discovered that a magnet ...”

##### Answers (example)  
“… can move metal objects through thin materials like paper or plastic without touching them.”

## 5. Maglev Inspiration – Move the Car! (Section 8MGq7GU72SLA – Teacher, Differentiation 2) – 20 min  

**Statement Box**  
A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.

**Image** – alt text: *A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.*

### Challenge (Coloured Box)  
“Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.”

**Instruction Box – Materials**  
• A toy car • 2 magnets • Sticky tape • Road track  
**Image** – alt text: *Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.*

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about magnet positioning and polarity.

---

#### 5a. Student Recording (Sub-section Fm3Xj3nGJSXd – Student)  
Students draw and complete the same four-step flow chart and finish the sentence:  
“By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets ...”

##### Answers (example)  
“… can work together to move another object without touching them.”

## 6. Magnets or Magic? (Section U4ByHnVMxfoR – Student, Differentiation 3) – 20 min  

**Statement Box**  
A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite. The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet. Many people thought that it had magic powers.

### Student Tasks  
1. Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers? (text response)  
2. Show how magnets can seem magical by creating your own magnet trick. Draw and label your trick.  
3. Try the trick on a classmate. (Coloured Box)

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, then perform it for the class.

### Answers (example)  
People could not see the invisible magnetic force, so when objects moved without being touched it seemed like magic.

---
