## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.  

(Teaching note reference ID: UvDpDYvMtXEj)

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
1. Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
2. Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
3. Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
4. Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

## Teacher Reading  
Magnetic materials (Tier 3)  
* Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

Poles (Tier 3)  
* Each magnet has a **north** and a **south** pole. When the same poles are brought together they *repel*, whereas opposite poles *attract*.

Non-contact force  
* Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field.

Common uses  
* Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact.

## Note – Vocabulary  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the cover image (alt text below) and ask:

> “What force can push or pull an object without touching it?”

Encourage students to share any experiences or objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Record responses to gauge current understanding and misconceptions.

## Lesson Flow – Sections and Activities  
The sections and subsections are presented here in the exact order of the overview:  

### 1. Section **V** – Exploring Magnetic Toys (Teacher page – ID VyTF0GATjpnH)

#### Activity 1 (5 min)  
Teaching Notes (ID uZkhKzJ4Zuno)  
> “Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.”

Student prompts (display or ask orally):  
* “What do they have in common?”  
  *Suggested answer*: “They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.”  
* “How do these toys work?”  
  *Suggested model bullets supplied in data (keep student language)*

Image (display for students)  
*Alt text*: *A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set.*

### 2. Section **k** – Magnet Hunt (Student page – ID okRZPyVN7yy9)  
  Sub-section **V** – Class Discussion (ID kzmMGYVr8Dsx)

#### Activity 2 (10 min)  
Instruction box (for students – appears on page)  
> “Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.”

Students complete the table (object / material / prediction / observation).  
Teaching Notes (ID cecidykKLW3Y) – *exact wording*:  
> “Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.”

After the hunt, conduct the class discussion prompts (sub-section):  
* “What did the magnets attract?” – *Model answer*: “Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.”  
* “What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?” – *Model answer*: “They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.”  
* “Were there any objects that surprised you?” – include sample answers list from data.  
* “Did anything unusual happen with any objects?” – include sample answers list.

Statement Box to reveal (purple border):  
> “The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it.”

Image for discussion  
*Alt text*: *A joyful child holding a magnet, with a colourful educational map in the background.*

### 3. Section **s** – Magnet Poles (Teacher page – ID V814N2svNRqM)  
  Sub-section **V** – Student recording (ID tXv0jarCYgkE)

#### Activity 3 (10 min) – Discovering Poles  
Teaching Notes (ID GRsoqoaK489y)  
> “Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.”

Teacher statement (purple box – read aloud):  
* “The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**.  
  They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
  Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.”

Student task (sub-section)  
1. Use two magnets to test like vs unlike poles.  
2. Complete the fill-in-the-blank sentences and drawing boxes.  
   *Exact sentence scaffold* (three versions provided on the page, answers below).  
3. Use colour cards provided (“north”, “south”, “attracted”, “repelled”) to label diagrams.  

Model answers (auto-mark or share after work):  
* Sentence 1: “I put a **north** pole and **south** pole together and they **attracted**.”  
* Sentence 2: “I put a **north** pole and **north** pole together and they **repelled**.”  
* Sentence 3: “I put a **south** pole and **south** pole together and they **repelled**.”

Image to support demonstration  
*Alt text*: *Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.*

### 4. Section **x** – Check-point Challenge: Paper-plate Paper-clip (Teacher page – ID 5jL5o62jDbWX)  
  Sub-section **V** – Materials & Instructions (ID m2MFrKkGR8AX)  
  Sub-section **k** – Student Response (ID tWREJXamRyc5)

#### Activity 4 (20 min) – Can a Magnet Move a Paper Clip Without Touching It?  
Teaching Notes (ID pa0tvwvj9Fkm)  
> “Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it…”

Speech bubble prompt (display):  
* “I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”

Discuss: “Do you think this is possible?” and “Explain your thinking.” (Model answer list provided.)

Teacher Challenge box (purple):  
> “Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.”
