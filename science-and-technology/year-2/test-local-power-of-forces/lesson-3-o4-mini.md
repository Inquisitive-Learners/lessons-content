## 3. Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

### Teaching Notes  
- Students explore sliding (“sliding” meaning how surfaces help or hinder movement).  
- **Discuss** what is meant by the word “sliding.” Encourage students to think about the penguin sliding example and surface textures such as bumpy, lumpy, rough, and smooth.  
- **Materials Needed:**  
  - A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
  - Three identical small block-shaped objects  
- **Explain** to students they will work in pairs to investigate how different surfaces affect how an object slides. Read through the materials list together and assist students to collect what they need. Possible materials for covering the ramp are:  
  - Rough sandpaper  
  - Aluminium foil  
  - Bubble wrap  
  - Felt  
  - Carpet  
  - Astro turf  
  - Velcro

## Section 3: Representing Friction Forces with Arrows

### 3.1 Teacher Explanation (Teacher-led)

- Statement Box (purple, bold):  
  **Friction always works in the** **opposite** **direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.**  
- Coloured Box:  
  > We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.  
- **Discussion Questions:**  
  1. Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?  
  2. In which direction is friction working?  
  3. In which direction is the box being pushed?  
- **Animation** of child in box being pushed:  
  - Image alt text: “A child joyfully sits in a cardboard box, pushed by an adult, illustrating friction and movement.”  

### Teaching Notes  
- Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force that moves an object. It’s not a property of a material alone but arises when two surfaces move against each other.  
- Direct attention to the arrows: friction arrow is shorter (weaker) than movement arrow. Arrows point in opposite directions.  

*(Teaching and Learning Sequence: iywcdbhxLfPv; owhiVoMwTrtV)*

### 3.2 Student Activity – Draw Arrows (Student)

**Draw** on the cartoon panels:  
- Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
- Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
- Label your arrows as **movement** and **friction**.

_Image:_ Four panels: a boy sliding, a woman shopping, a girl on a scooter, and a boy raking leaves.

## Section 4: Exploring Friction in Footwear (Student)

**Statement Box:**  
> When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. The surface you move on and the soles (bottoms) of your shoes are always touching and rubbing together. The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.

_Image of four pairs of sports footwear._  
_Alt text:_ “Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.”

### Activity – Categorise Shoes

**Look at the shoes. Then complete the table:**

| Shoes | For which type of activity are the shoes designed? | For which type of surface are the shoes designed? |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| A     |                                                    |                                                   |
| B     |                                                    |                                                   |
| C     |                                                    |                                                   |
| D     |                                                    |                                                   |

*(Students fill in table.)*

### Teaching Notes

### Subsection 4.1: Which Provide Most/Least Friction? (Student)

1. **Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?**  
2. **Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?**

**Model Answers:**  
- **Most friction:** Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.  
- **Least friction:** Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.

*(Teaching and Learning Sequence: syZzGnju5E3c)*

## Section 5: Designing a New Shoe (Student)

**Activity:** Design a new shoe for a special place or activity.  
**Instructions:**  
- Draw and label it.  
- Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.  

_Coloured Box (grey/box):_  
> Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.

_Image of snowshoes:_  
_Alt text:_ “A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground, with footprints nearby.”

**Informational Statement:**  
> Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop.
