# Lesson: Friction

---

## Lesson Overview

**Lesson Name:** Friction  
**Focus Question:** What slows an object down?  
**Learning Intention:**  
- Students are learning to describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

**Success Criteria:**  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

**Teacher Reading:**  
Friction as a force  
> Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

Surface texture and friction  
> All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

**Note (Vocabulary Words):**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** throughout the lesson.

## Section 1: Investigating Friction on Different Surfaces  
**Activity (20 min, Differentiation 1)**  
**Teaching Notes:**  
- Discuss what is meant by “sliding.”  
- Show samples of sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap; let students feel each material.  
- Ask: Which block will slide first on the ramp? Why?  
- Materials needed (per pair):  
  - A piece of cardboard ramp with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials (e.g., sandpaper, foil, bubble wrap, felt, carpet, astro turf, velcro, plastic wrap)  
  - Three identical small blocks  

### 1.1 Prediction (Think–Pair–Share)  
- **Prompt:** Which block do you think will slide down the ramp first? Explain your thinking.  
- **Prompt:** Which block do you think will slide last? Explain your thinking.  
- **Image:** Hand holding a layered board labelled with bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper.  
- **Model Answers:**  
  - First slide: _“The block on the foil will slide first because foil is smoother than the other surfaces.”_  
  - Last slide: _“It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.”_

### 1.2 Investigative Setup  
- **Teacher Instruction:** With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question: **Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?**  
- **Materials Checklist:**  
  - Ramp with three different covering materials  
  - Three identical small blocks  
- **Image:** Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.

### 1.3 Making Predictions  
- **Step 1:** Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
- **Step 2:** Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, lined up evenly.  
- **Prompt:** On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?  
  - _Model answer:_ “It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has less bumps than the others and it is easier for the block to move over it.”  
- **Prompt:** On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?  
  - _Model answer:_ “It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.”

### 1.4 Observation  
- **Step 3:** Slowly and steadily lift the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it until all blocks slide to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.  
- **Activity:** Draw and label what happened.  
- **(Open response; no fixed answer.)**

### 1.5 Recording Results  
- **Step 4:** Record your results.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - Which ramp surface required the smallest tilt to make a box slide?  
    - _Model answer:_ “The foil surface needed the lowest lift.”  
  - Which ramp surface required the highest tilt to make a box slide?  
    - _Model answer:_ “Sandpaper needed the highest lift.”  
  - Why do you think that is?  
    - _Model answer:_ “It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.”  
  - Why do you think that is?  
    - _Model answer:_ “It is the roughest material and slows the block down.”

## Section 2: Exploring Friction in Text (eBook Reading)  
**Activity (5 min, Checkpoint, Differentiation 1)**  
1. **Instruction Box:** Read the eBook to learn more.  
2. **Statement Box:**  
   **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  
3. Ask students:  
   - Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?  
   - When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?

## Section 3: Describing Friction with Words  
**Checkpoint Activity (Differentiation 1)**  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students complete sentences using the word bank and then write their own sentence explaining friction on another surface.

1. **Word Bank:**  
   - rough bumpy smooth weak strong  
2. **Fill-in-the-Blanks:**  
   - Sandpaper has a **___** surface so it makes **___** friction.  
     - Answers: **rough**, **strong**  
   - Ice has a **___** surface so it makes **___** friction.  
     - Answers: **smooth**, **weak**  
3. **Prompt:** Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.  
   - _(Student response.)_

## Section 4: Using Arrows to Show Friction and Movement  
**Activity (10 min, Checkpoint, Differentiation 1)**  
**Teaching Notes:**  
- Reinforce that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force moving an object.  
- Explain arrow length shows relative strength.  

1. **Statement Box:**  
   Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  
2. **Coloured Box:** We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.  
3. **Discussion Prompts:**  
   - Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?  
     - _Model answer:_ “Friction is usually a weaker force than the push force moving the box, so it shows that friction tries to slow the box down but is not as strong as the push of the man.”  
   - In which direction is friction working?  
     - _Model answer:_ “Friction is working in the opposite direction to the direction the box is being pushed.”  
   - In which direction is the box being pushed?  
     - _Model answer:_ “The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer green movement arrow.”  
4. **Animation:** A child joyfully sits in a cardboard box, pushed by an adult, illustrating friction and movement.  
5. **Draw Task:**  
   - Draw two arrows on the cartoon panels: one showing movement, one showing friction.  
   - Label them “movement” and “friction.”  
   - _Model illustration available: Illustration showing movement and friction in various activities: sliding, shopping, scootering, grooming._

## Section 5: Friction in Everyday Footwear  
**Activity (10 min, Differentiation 2)**  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore different shoes and decide activities and surfaces they are designed for.

1. **Statement Box:**  
   When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. The surface you move on and the soles (bottoms) of your shoes are always touching and rubbing together. The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.  
2. **Image:** Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.  
3. **Table Task:** Look at the shoes. Then complete the table.

| Shoes | For which type of activity are the shoes designed? | For which type of surface are the shoes designed? |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| A     | Climbing or hiking                                 | Ice or snow                                       |
| B     | Ballet dancing                                     | Smooth wooden stage floors                        |
| C     | Football games                                     | Grass                                             |
| D     | Rollerskating                                      | Smooth paths or skating rinks                     |

## Section 6: Identifying Most and Least Friction in Shoes  
**Elaborate Activity (10 min, Differentiation 2)**  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students identify which shoes provide the most and least friction and justify their answers.

- **Prompt:** Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
  - _Model answer:_ “Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.”  
- **Prompt:** Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  
  - _Model answer:_ “Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.”  
- **Draw Task:** Think of a time when you have or might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.  
  - _(Student response.)_

## Section 7: Designing Shoes for Specific Friction Needs  
**Elaborate Activity (15 min, Differentiation 3)**  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer. Have them present their drawings to show their understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.

1. **Prompt:** Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.  
   - _(Student response.)_  
2. **Coloured Box Reminder:** Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.  
3. **Images for Inspiration:**  
   - A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground, with footprints nearby.  
   - Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop.
