## 1. Learning Intention

**Students are learning to:**
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

---

## 2. Success Criteria

**By the end of this lesson, students will:**
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.
- Use the vocabulary 'push', 'pull', 'towards' and 'away from' in compound sentences to describe forces.
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

---

## 3. Teacher Reading

**Forces**
- A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**
- A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**
- Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**
- Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## 4. Note

**Vocabulary Words**
- The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## 5. Introduction

Show students the image (Alt text: "Three children play on grass. One pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it from behind while another sits inside, smiling.") and ask the focus question:
- "What makes things move?"
- Have them recall everyday examples of movement such as toys and vehicles, helping them connect to their own experiences.
- Document and use students' responses to gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Section 1: Watch the video Sledding Teamwork

### Main Activity

- **Instruction:** Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.
- **Teaching Notes:** Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word 'force' here.

### Discussion Questions:

1. **How did they get the sled to move?**
   - *Suggested Answer:* The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.

2. **Why is it called Sledding Teamwork?**
   - *Suggested Answer:* They needed more than one person to make the sled move.

---

## Section 2: Why do things move? (Tug-of-war, Bike, Pram)

### Main Activity

- **Key Statement:** 
  - Things can’t move by themselves.
  - An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.
- **Teaching Notes:** Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

### Discussion Questions (with images):
1. **Why is the rope moving?**
   - *Image Alt Text:* Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.
   - *Suggested Answer:* The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.

2. **What is making the bike move?**
   - *Image Alt Text:* A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.
   - *Suggested Answer:* The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.

3. **What is making the pram move?**
   - *Image Alt Text:* A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.
   - *Suggested Answer:* The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.

## Section 3: Forces and Classification

### Main Activity

- **Key Statement:** Pushes and pulls are called forces. Forces make objects move.
- **Teaching Notes:** Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. 

### Interactive
- *Instruction Box:* Decide if each force is a push or a pull.
- *Interactive:* Students classify forces as push or pull.

---

## Section 4: Push or Pull Direction

### Main Activity

- **Key Statement:** When we push an object, it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.
- **Teaching Notes:** Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed.

#### [Subsection] Play Forces Charades

- *Instruction:* Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.  

- *How to play:*
  - Select an activity from the brainstorm list.
  - Act it out for a classmate to guess.
  - Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

- *Example:* “I pull the rope so it moves towards me.”

- *Image Alt Text:* A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war.

- *Words in word bank:* pull, push, towards, away from

#### [Subsection] Brainstorm Activities
- *Instruction:* As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.
- *Example image*: Whiteboard displaying the text: "Example: Opening and closing a door." with an eraser.

- *Note for teachers:* Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat.

- *Example brainstorm answers:*
  - Throwing (pushing) a ball
  - Brushing teeth
  - Opening and closing doors
  - Unzipping a bag
  - Opening a book
  - Rowing a boat (pulling the oars toward you, pushing them away)
  - Moving a chair to a new spot (pulling it out, pushing it into place)

## Section 5: Arrows and the Direction of Force

### Main Activity

- **Key Statement:** We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.
- *Teaching Notes:* Students observe how arrows are used to show the direction of a force. They examine the pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow's direction of movement.

- *Instruction Box:* Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?

#### Student Activities (with images and answers):

1. **A worker pushes a wheelbarrow**  
   *Image Alt Text:* A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil, arrow indicating direction of force.  
   - *Question:* Push or pull?

### Main Activity

- **Key Statement:** Investigate how things move.
- **Teaching Notes:** Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.

- *Instruction:*
  - Choose three things to investigate.
  - Use a force to make each thing move.
  - Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.
  - Label if it was a push or a pull.
  - Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.

- *Image Example Alt Text:* Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force. 
- *Sample description:* I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.

- **Assessment Note:** This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

#### [Subsection]: Student Investigation

- *Task:* Students draw a picture of each object in motion, use an arrow to show the direction of the force, label whether the force was a push or a pull, and use the word bank to complete sentences that describe how each object moved.

    - Example sentence structure:   
      "I [push/pull] the [object] so it moved [towards/away from] me."
