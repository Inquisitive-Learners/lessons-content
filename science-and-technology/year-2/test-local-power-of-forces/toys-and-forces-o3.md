# Lesson: Toys and Forces  
Lesson URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6284-toys-and-forces  

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.  *(Nxr0imGgp2KX)*  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
2. Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
3. Explain that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
4. Draw and label a flow-chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.  *(FLbfSk5rSst6)*  

## Teacher Reading  *(jNabMq0kXRPy)*  
• Push and pull forces set objects in motion or stop them.  
• A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects.  
• Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long tradition of creating spinning toys that demonstrate knowledge of motion and design.

## Note  *(UMMz5DnxTRWe)*  
Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson. These low-frequency, subject-specific words should be explicitly taught in context.

## Introduction  *(7PTNKegB12uY)*  
Show students the cover image of the father and son with spinning toys. Ask:  
“How do toys work?”  
Record student ideas to gauge current understanding and misconceptions.

## Focus Question  
How do toys work?

# Activity-by-Activity Guide  
(All sections and subsections appear below in the exact order provided in the *Sections Overview*.)

---

## 1. Kendama: Push or Pull?  
Section ID: `yBk3rdhKDy2s` (sort “V”)

### Student Components  
1. Statement box – “A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy…”  
2. Instruction – “Click on the kendama to watch the video.”  
3. Video of a kendama in action.  
4. Question (discussion-response): **“Which part is pushed?”**  
5. Question (discussion-response): **“Which part is pulled?”**  
6. Image – Cartoon boy thinking with a large question mark. *(Alt text already supplied.)*

### Teaching Notes  *(BHerUr93FMcr)*  
Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage discussion of how pushing and pulling create different motions. Have students share what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

### Answers (examples)  
• Which part is pushed? – “The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.” *(ai-2EGUJ1Nt1X86)*  
• Which part is pulled? – “We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.” *(ai-K9RitPSfTfnf)*

## 2. Push and Pull with the Stick  
Section ID: `UJxAU73ooH2i` (sort “o”)

### Student Components  
• Two statement boxes:  
  – “When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.”  
  – “When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.”  
• Two Rive animations showing “Push – Ball goes up” and “Pull – Catch ball”.

### Teaching Notes  *(e0tPPniwcFej)*  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up and how pulling helps catch it. Let students act out the movements to feel the push and pull forces.

## 3. Think–Pair–Share: Other Toys that Need a Push or Pull  
Section ID: `2nE1nrDzbbJt` (sort “s”)

### Student Components (main section)  
1. Statement box – “Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.”  
2. Grey box – *Think, Pair, Share.*  
3. Draw space – “Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.”  
4. Discussion – “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?”

### Teaching Notes  *(d7yUi99HZ2mA)*  
Students identify other toys that use push or pull forces. In pairs, they draw and label their examples with arrows showing the direction of the forces.

### Answers (examples) *(AgAtGRxoht3g)*  
Lists of push toys, pull toys, and toys that use both push and pull (see suggested answer text in full).

### 3a. Video Study: Another Spinning Top  
Sub-section ID: `Xe5vznb9fgKa` (sort “V”)

**Student Components**  
• Instruction box – “Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.”  
• Video of a spinning top (Stimulus 19250).  
• Two discussion questions:  
  1. **“Why is the spinning top moving?”**  
  2. **“How is it moving?”**

**Teaching Notes**  *(BpiTjbsXjEQR)*  
Guide students to identify the forces that start the spinning and keep it going.

**Answers (examples)**  
• Why moving? – “Someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it.” *(ai-XproUiTEBJNw)*  
• How moving? – “It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down.” *(ai-F8SuVvCBX97c)*  

---

### 3b. Cultural Connections: Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Spinning Tops  
Sub-section ID: `VADBSaYJCxrp` (sort “F”)

**Student Components**  
• Statement box – “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a rich history of making and using spinning tops.”  
• Link to the Australian Museum website.  
• Five discussion prompts:  
  1. **“Who used the spinning tops?”**  
  2. **“What are they made from?”**  
  3. **“What did you find interesting?”**  
  4. **“How do they move?”**  
  5. Instruction list guiding students to explore the website.

**Teaching Notes**  *(aq22f5KzDCDn)*  
Have students explore the online collection, choose a spinning top, discuss materials and forces, then draw it.

**Answers (examples)**
