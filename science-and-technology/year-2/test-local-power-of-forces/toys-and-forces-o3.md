# Toys and Forces  
URL: <https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6284-toys-and-forces>

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
2. Identify how spinning tops from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples are made and how they move.  
3. Explain that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
4. Draw and label a flow-chart that shows how a spinning top is made and moved.

## Teacher Reading  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects (e.g. spinning a top).  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, demonstrating deep knowledge of motion and design.

## Note  
**Vocabulary words** in this lesson are Tier 2 and Tier 3, subject-specific words. They appear in **bold** within the lesson and should be taught in context to build content knowledge.

## Introduction  
Show students the cover image and ask the focus question, “How do toys work?”.  
Encourage students to share experiences with their own toys. Record ideas to check prior knowledge and identify misconceptions.

## Focus Question  
**How do toys work?**

# Lesson Sequence  
(Sections and subsections are listed in the exact order shown in the overview.)

---

## 1. Kendama – Push or Pull?  *(Section “V” – id yBk3rdhKDy2s)*  

**Student content (exact wording)**  
* A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy.  
* It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.  
* Click on the kendama to watch the video.

**Activity 1 (7HpjbEkfuwUu – 5 min)**  
Students watch the kendama video and respond to the two prompts:

| Sub-activity | Prompt (exact wording for students) | Response type |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| a. | “Which part is pushed?” | text / draw / upload |
| b. | “Which part is pulled?” | text / draw / upload |

**Teaching Notes**  
*Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage discussion about how pushing and pulling create different motions. Have students share what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.*

**Example Answers**  
* Pushed part – *The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.*  
* Pulled part – *We pull the handle toward us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.*

## 2. Push and Pull in Action *(Section “o” – id UJxAU73ooH2i)*  

**Student content (exact wording)**  
* “When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.”  
* “When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.”

**Activity 2 (puqFUa8mfg2s – 5 min)**  
Two side-by-side **Rive animations** allow students to explore:

* Push – “Push stick / Ball goes up”  
* Pull – “Pull stick / Catch ball”

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up and pulling it helps catch the ball. Invite students to act out the movements to feel the push–pull forces.

#### Sub-activity “zz” – Discussion  
Prompt: “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?”  
Response: text / draw / upload  

#### Sub-activity “zw” – Draw  
Instruction: “Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both make each toy move.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* to identify toys that use push or pull forces. They draw and label their examples, using arrows for each force.

**Example Answers**  
(see sample lists in suggested answers)

### 3b. Sub-section “V” – Watch Another Spinning Top *(id Xe5vznb9fgKa)*  

Instruction Box: “Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.”

**Video** (D7B6c2KLRwEL) followed by two prompts:

| Prompt | Response type |
|--------|---------------|
| “Why is the spinning top moving?” | text / draw / upload |
| “How is it moving?” | text / draw / upload |

**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch the video and discuss which forces start the spinning and how they keep it moving.

**Example Answers**  
* It’s moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.  
* It is spinning on its tip until it slows and stops, also gliding forward a little.
