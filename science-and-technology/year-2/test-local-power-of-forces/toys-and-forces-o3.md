*(Source: “Students are learning to:” – Intention)*  

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
2. Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
3. Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
4. Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.  

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.  

**Cultural perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

# Lesson Sequence  
The sections and subsections below follow **exactly** the order set out in the Sections Overview.

---

## Section 1 – Kendama (Activity ID 7HpjbEkfuwUu)  
### Main Teaching Points  
* A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy with a wooden ball attached by string to a handle.  
* Pushing and pulling different parts make it work.

### Classroom Flow  
1. Read the statement box aloud:  
   “A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.”  
2. “Click on the kendama to watch the video.”  
3. Show the video and image (alt text: “Cartoon boy thinking with a large question mark above his head.”).  
4. Students answer the two questions:

| Question (exact wording) | Response type | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| “Which part is pushed?” | text / draw / upload | *Example answer:* The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air. |
| “Which part is pulled?” | text / draw / upload | *Example answer:* We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup. |

### Teaching Notes (exact wording)  
“Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.”  

---

## Section 2 – Push and Pull on a Kendama (Activity ID puqFUa8mfg2s)  
(Subsection follows Section 1 in the overview)

### Main Teaching Points  
* Pushing the stick sends the ball up.  
* Pulling the stick helps catch the ball.

### Classroom Flow  
1. Display the two statement boxes side-by-side:  
   • “When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up in the air.”  
   • “When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.”  
2. Show the two Rive animations:  
   • Animation 1 (alt text: “Child with a push stick, focused on making a ball rise above his hand.”).  
   • Animation 2 (alt text: “A child with a toy demonstrating the actions ‘Pull stick’ and ‘Catch ball’. ”).

### Teaching Notes  
“Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.”  

---

## Section 3 – Many Toys Need a Push or Pull (Activity ID wxTCCoBmDEhx)  

### 3A. Main Section  
**Statement Box**  
“Many other toys  need a push, a pull or both to work.”  

**Think, Pair, Share** *(in italics)*  
Instruction: “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?”  
Response types: text / draw / upload  

*Example answers* (abridged): students might list toy cars (push), yo-yos (pull), stretchy action figures (push & pull)…  

**Draw Task**  
Instruction: “Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull or both  make each toy move.”  
*Example answer:* Students could draw a toy car with a forward arrow, a yo-yo with up/down arrows, etc.

**Teaching Notes**  
“Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.”

### 3B. Sub-section 3B – Spinning-Top Video (ID Xe5vznb9fgKa)  
*Instruction box:* “Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.”  

| Discussion question | Response type | Example answer |
|---|---|---|
| “Why is the spinning top moving?” | text / draw / upload | It’s moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around. |
| “How is it moving?” | text / draw / upload | It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. |

Video alt text: *(none supplied – teacher may preview video ahead of lesson)*

**Teaching Notes**  
“Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.”

## Section 5 – Make Your Own Spinning Top (Checkpoint Activity ID yBynGkTiEXic)  
Materials (per student)  
• Cardboard circles (cut into round circles)  
• One stick  

Instruction box:  
“Make your own spinning top.  
You will need a small cardboard circle cut-out and a stick.”  

Flow-chart draw task (alt text: “A flow chart with arrows, labelled ‘First’, ‘Then’, ‘Next’, and ‘Finally’. ”)  
Instruction: “Draw and label how you created your spinning top and how you made it move.”  

*Example answer (flow-chart)*  
• First, cut a cardboard circle.  
• Then, poke a hole and slide a stick through.  
• Next, hold it upright.  
• Finally, twist the stick to spin the top.  

Rive animation (alt text: “Hands demonstrating how to attach a stick to a round, white piece of paper, to then spin.”)

**Teaching Notes**  
“Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how they made their spinning top move.”  

*(Assessment note)*  
“This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.”

## Section 6 – Design a Faster Spinning Top (Activity ID 5TLrtm6xsuAN)  
Statement box: “Design your own spinning top. How could you make it go faster? ”  

Sub-tasks inside a two-column layout:  
1. **Design ideas** – draw space (alt text: “An empty thought bubble.”)  
2. **Draw and label what happened** – draw space  

*Example design answer:* “I designed a spinning top with a larger cardboard circle and a longer handle. I might add weights around the circle to keep it balanced.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
“Students now design their own spinning top. Remind them of the video they watched, and explain how their design needs to show how a push or a pull makes it move. Students consider how they could make their spinning top go faster, before drawing and labelling what happened in the space provided.”

## Section 7 – Forces in Totem Tennis (Activity ID 6ay9pJjLz00s)  
Image alt text: “Boy hitting a ball on the totem tennis structure with a paddle.”  

Statement box: “Totem tennis is a game where you hit a ball. The ball is attached to a pole with a rope. ”  

### Tasks  
1. **Draw and label a diagram**  
   Instruction: “Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing totem tennis.”  
2. **Describe**  
   Instruction: “Describe how you can make the ball go faster.”  

*Example answers*  
• Diagram: draw ball on rope, arrow for paddle push, arrow showing circular motion.  
• Description: “You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
“This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’ attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis. Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster. ”
