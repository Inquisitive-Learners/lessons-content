## 1. Whole-lesson essentials  

**Learning Intention**  
Students are learning to:  
• Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.  

**Success Criteria**  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
• Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
• Identify how spinning tops from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples are made and how they move.  
• Explain that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
• Draw and label a flow-chart that shows how a spinning top is made and how it moves.

**Teacher Reading**  
Push and pull  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.  

Twisting  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.  

Cultural perspectives  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys, showing a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

**Note**  
Vocabulary Words  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

**Introduction**  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, “How do toys work?” Encourage students to share personal experiences with toys they use. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**Focus Question**  
How do toys work?

## 3. Detailed activity breakdown  

### 3.1  Kendama – which parts are pushed or pulled?  *(Section 1 – 5 min)*  
Media  
• Video of a kendama being used  
• Image: Cartoon boy thinking with a large question mark above his head.  
Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

Student tasks  
1. “Which part is pushed?” – text/draw/upload response  
   Model answer: *The handle is pushed upwards to lift the ball into the air.*  
2. “Which part is pulled?” – text/draw/upload response  
   Model answer: *We pull the handle towards us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.*

---

### 3.2  Push or pull?  *(Section 2 – 5 min)*  
Media  
• Two Rive animations (push / pull) showing a child using a kendama.

Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up in the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

There are no written answers required for this activity.

### 3.3  Many toys need a push, a pull or both  *(Section 3 parent – 15 min)*  

#### 3.3 a  Think, Pair, Share  
Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

Student tasks  
1. Discussion: “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?”  
   Model answer includes push toys, pull toys and push-and-pull toys (see full list in suggested answers).  
2. Draw and label toys, using arrows to show pushes and pulls.  
   Model drawing examples include: toy car (push), yo-yo (push & pull), etc.

#### 3.3 b  Watch another spinning-top video  *(Sub-section Xe5vznb9fgKa)*  
Media  
• Short video of a spinning top.  

Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.

Student questions  
• “Why is the spinning top moving?”  
  Model answer: *It's moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.*  
• “How is it moving?”  
  Model answer: *It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It is also propelling forward slowly with the spinning force.*

#### 3.3 c  Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander spinning tops  *(Sub-section VADBSaYJCxrp)*  
Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students investigate spinning tops made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and discuss what makes them move. Encourage them to explore which forces are used and reflect on the materials used. Ask students to share what they found interesting about the spinning tops.

Student questions  
• “Who used the spinning tops?” – *Children use them for fun and men use them for competitions.*  
• “What are they made from?” – *e.g. small gourds on sticks secured with fibre & resin; beeswax on thin wood sticks.*  
• “What did you find interesting?” – varied answers.  
• “How do they move?” – *They spin around when you twist or flick them.*

### 3.4  Twist – a push **and** a pull  *(Section 4 – 10 min)*  
Media  
• Image: Hand twisting a spinning top; statement box.  

Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students examine an image showing how a twist is both a push and a pull. Students draw other examples of other things that require a twist.

Student task  
• Draw and label some other things we can twist.  
  Model answers: bottle lid, doorknob, wind-up toy, etc.

---

### 3.5  Checkpoint: Make a cardboard spinning top  *(Section 5 – 15 min – **Checkpoint Activity**)*  
Materials  
• 1 small cardboard circle (cut in advance)  
• 1 stick  

Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how they made their spinning top move.

Additional Teaching Note – from activity description  
> Students create their own spinning top from a cardboard circle and a stick, focusing on how twists set it in motion. They draw and label each step in the construction and movement on a flow chart, showing which forces are at work.

Student task  
• Draw and label a flow-chart (“First… Then… Next… Finally…”) that shows the construction steps and how the top moves.  
  Model answer provided in suggested answers (“First, I cut out a cardboard circle… Finally, I twisted the stick to spin the top.”)

### 3.6  Design a faster spinning top  *(Section 6 – 20 min – Differentiation 2)*  
Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students design their own spinning top and explore how to make it spin faster. Encourage them to experiment with size, shape or materials and note any changes in speed. Have them draw and label their findings, explaining which ideas worked best for a faster spin.

Student tasks  
1. “Design ideas” – annotated drawing of the planned top.  
   Model answer: *A larger cardboard disc, longer handle, weights around the rim for balance.*  
2. “Draw and label what happened.” – record of testing.  
   Answers will vary.

### 3.7  Totem tennis – forces in action  *(Section 7 – 20 min – Differentiation 3)*  
Media  
• Image: Boy hitting a ball on a Totem Tennis set.

Teaching Notes – use verbatim  
> Students explore the game of totem tennis to see how hitting the ball makes it move around the pole. Prompt students to draw and label the directions of forces they think are in action, and reflect on which force makes the ball go faster. Have them explain these forces in their diagrams and describe their impact on speed.

Student tasks  
1. Draw and label a diagram with arrows showing the directions of forces.  
   Model answer: arrows for the push from the paddle and the pull of the rope around the pole.  
2. “Describe how you can make the ball go faster.” – text response  
   Model answer: *Hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.*
