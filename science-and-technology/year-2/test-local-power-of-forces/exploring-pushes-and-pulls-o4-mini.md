## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

# Lesson Sequence

### Section 1 (Engage)  
**Instruction:** Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.  
**Activity:** Video – *Sledding Teamwork*  

**Discussion Questions:**  
1. **How did they get the sled to move?**  
   - *Suggested Answer:* The woman pushed the sled from behind and the man pulled it from the front. They needed more than one person to make the sled move.  
2. **Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?**  
   - *Suggested Answer:* Because more than one person worked together—one pushed and one pulled—to move the sled.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word 'force' here.

---

### Section 2 (Explore)  
**Statement:** Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.  

**Activities & Discussion:**  
- **Video/Animation 1** (Children tugging a rope – *alt:* "Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.")  
  - *Question:* Why is the rope moving?  
  - *Answer:* The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.  
- **Video/Animation 2** (Child riding a bike – *alt:* "A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.")  
  - *Question:* What is making the bike move?  
  - *Answer:* The child is pushing down on the pedals and the woman is also pushing the bike along.  
- **Video/Animation 3** (Woman pushing pram – *alt:* "A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.")  
  - *Question:* What is making the pram move?  
  - *Answer:* The pram is moving because the woman is pushing it.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

---

### Section 3 (Explain)  
**Statement:** Pushes and pulls are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.  

**Activity:** Interactive classification – students decide if each force shown is a push or a pull.  

**Instruction:** Decide if each force is a push or a pull.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull.  Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.  
>  
> It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, ‘push’ and ‘pull’ are introduced as nouns as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as ‘Pull the car seat belt’ they are used as verbs.

---

### Section 4 (Explain)  
**Statement:** When we push an object, it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.

**Activity:** Fill in the blanks using the words **push**, **pull**, **away from**, **towards**.

1. **Sentence 1:**  
   I □□ the suitcase so it moves □□ me.  
   - Answers: **pull** / **towards**  
   - *Image:* A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background. *alt:* "A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background."  
2. **Sentence 2:**  
   I □□ the trolley so it moves □□ me.  
   - Answers: **push** / **away from**  
   - *Image:* A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags. *alt:* "A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags."  

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements, before using the provided words to  complete the sentences.

#### Subsection 4.1 (Consolidate: Forces Charades)  
**Instruction:** Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.

**How to play:**  
- Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
- Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
- Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.  

*Example Statement:*  
> *I pull the rope so it moves towards me.*

*Image:* A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war. *alt:* "A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war."

*Word Cards:* pull | push | away from | towards

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students consolidate their understanding by playing *Forces Charades*, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess.  Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasise how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

---

#### Subsection 4.2 (Collaborative Brainstorm)  
**Instruction:** As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat. They work together to brainstorm everyday activities that require a push, a pull or both, considering how each action moves objects.

---

### Section 5 (Explain)  
**Statement:** We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.

**Activity:** For each picture, decide: **Push or pull?**  
1. Worker pushing wheelbarrow (*alt:* "A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil, arrow indicating direction of force.")  
   - **Push**  
2. One figure helping another climb by pulling (*alt:* "Two stick figures: one helping the other climb from a lower platform by pulling up. An arrow indicates direction of force.")  
   - **Pull**  
3. Silhouette pulling a box by rope (*alt:* "A silhouetted figure pulls a box towards them with a rope. An arrow indicates direction of force.")  
   - **Pull**  
4. Hand pressing a button (*alt:* "A hand pressing down on a button with an arrow indicating the direction of force.")  
   - **Push**  
5. Figure pushing a large box (*alt:* "A figure pushing a large box, with an arrow indicating direction of force.")  
   - **Push**  
6. Hand pulling down a blind (*alt:* "A hand pulling down a blackout blind with a red arrow indicating the direction of force.")  
   - **Pull**

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine the pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow's direction of movement.

---

### Section 6 (Evaluate / Investigate)  
**Inquiry Task:** Investigate how things move.

**Instructions:**  
1. Choose three things to investigate.  
2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
3. Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.  
4. Label if it was a push or a pull.  
5. Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.

*Image Example:* Hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force. *alt:* "Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force."

*Worked Example:*  
> I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Explain to students they will be   using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.  
>  
> This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

---

#### Subsection 6.1 (Student Investigation)  
**Instructions:**  
- Draw each of your three chosen objects in motion.  
- Use an arrow to show the direction of the force.  
- Label each as a push or pull.  
- Use the word bank to complete sentences describing how each object moved.

**Word Bank:** pushed | pulled | away from | towards

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students draw a picture of each object in motion, using an arrow to show the direction of the force. They label whether the force was a push or a pull, and use the word bank to complete sentences that describe how each object moved.

---

### Section 7 (Elaborate)  
**Statement:** Many action words are used to describe forces.

**Activity:** Act out the words on the tiles and then sort them into the correct group (Push / Pull).

**Words:**  
- shove  
- stretch  
- throw  
- tug  
- press  
- tow  
- drag  
- close  

**Answer (example):**  
> Push words: shove, press, throw and close.  
> Pull words: tug, stretch, tow and drag.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into push and pull.

---

#### Subsection 7.1 (Action Word Cards)  
**Instructions:**  
- Select four of the action words from the sorting activity to complete the cards.  
- Record the action.  
- Draw a picture showing the action.  
- Label it as a push or a pull.  
- Draw an arrow to show the direction of the force.

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students select four action words from the previous slide and create cards that show how each word represents a push or a pull. They draw an arrow to show the direction of movement and label the picture to show the force.

---

### Section 8 (Elaborate)  
**Activity:** Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.

*Image:* Two blank white squares with black outlines side by side. *alt:* "Two blank white squares with black outlines side by side."

**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects using a push or a pull.

**Statement (conclusion):**  
Objects can be pushed and pulled by living and non-living things.

**Suggested Responses (examples):**  
- The weather: wind or rain can push or pull objects such as leaves, balls and trees.  
- Water: a river can push or pull objects along it.  
- Trucks and diggers can push and pull objects.  
- Robots and games that use mechanical parts to push and pull.
