## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to: Identify a force as a push or a pull.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary **push**, **pull**, **towards** and **away from** in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, *What makes things move?*  
Have them recall everyday examples of movement such as toys and vehicles, helping them connect to their own experiences. Document and use students' responses to gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Section 1: Engage – Sledding Teamwork  
**Teaching Notes (Engage)**  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word “force” here.

**Instructions**  
Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.

**Discussion Questions**  
1. How did they get the sled to move?  
   *Example Answer:* The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
2. Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?  
   *Example Answer:* They needed more than one person to make the sled move.

## Section 2: Explore – Objects at Rest Stay at Rest  
**Teaching Notes (Explore)**  
Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

1. **Statement:**  
   > Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.

2. **Animations & Discussion**  
   - **Rope Tug**  
     *Animation alt:* Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.  
     *Question:* Why is the rope moving?  
     *Example Answer:* The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.

   - **Bike Ride**  
     *Animation alt:* A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.  
     *Question:* What is making the bike move?  
     *Example Answer:* The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.

   - **Pram Push**  
     *Animation alt:* A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.  
     *Question:* What is making the pram move?  
     *Example Answer:* The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.

## Section 3: Explain – Using Arrows to Show Forces  
**Teaching Notes (Explain)**  
Students observe how **arrows** can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction of movement.

**Instructions**  
We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force. Look at each picture and decide if it is a push or a pull.

## Section 4: Explore & Explain – Pushes and Pulls Are Forces  
**Teaching Notes (Explore & Explain)**  
Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.

**Statement:**  
> Pushes **and** pulls are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.

**Interactive**  
Decide if each force is a push or a pull.  
*(Interactive classification activity)*

## Section 5: Elaborate – Action Word Sorting  
**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into push and pull.

**Introduction:**  
Many action words are used to describe forces.

**Instructions:**  
Act out the words on the tiles and then sort them into the correct group.

**Words to Sort**  
- shove  
- throw  
- press  
- close  
- stretch  
- tug  
- tow  
- drag  

*Push words: shove, press, throw and close.*  
*Pull words: tug, stretch, tow and drag.*

## Section 6: Elaborate – Non-living Things That Move Objects  
**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects using a push or a pull.

**Statement:**  
> Objects can be pushed and pulled by living and non-living things.

**Instructions:**  
Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.

**Example Responses:**  
- The weather: wind or rain can push or pull objects such as leaves, balls and trees.  
- Water: a river can push or pull objects along it.  
- Trucks and diggers can push and pull objects.  
- Robots and games that use mechanical parts to push and pull.

## Section 7: Explore & Explain – Push vs Pull Direction  
**Teaching Notes (Explore & Explain)**  
Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move **away** from us, while pulling an object causes it to move **towards** us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements before using the provided words to complete the sentences.

**Statement:**  
> When we push an object, it moves **away** from us.  
> When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.

**Sentence 1:**  
```
I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.
```
- *Image:* A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.  
  *(alt: A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.)*  
- **Answer:** pull / towards

**Sentence 2:**  
```
I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ me.
```
- *Image:* A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags.  
  *(alt: A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags.)*  
- **Answer:** push / away from

## Section 8: Elaborate – Forces Charades (Student Choice)  
**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
Students consolidate their understanding by playing *Forces Charades*, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess. Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasise how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

**Instructions:**  
Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.

**How to play:**  
- Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
- Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
- Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

> *I pull the rope so it moves towards me.* *(example)*

*Image:* A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war.  
*(alt: A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war.)*

**Word Bank:**  
- pull  
- push  
- towards  
- away from

## Section 9: Evaluate – Investigating Forces  
**Teaching Notes (Evaluate & Worked Example)**  
Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.

**Instructions:**  
Investigate how things move.

1. Choose three things to investigate.  
2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
3. Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.  
4. Label if it was a push or a pull.  
5. Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.

**Worked Example:**  
*Image:* Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.  
*(alt: Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.)*  
> I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.

## Section 10: Evaluate – Recording Investigation (Student Task)  
**Teaching Notes (Assessment)**  
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**Instructions:**  
For each of the three objects:

- Draw a picture of the object in motion, showing the direction of the force with an arrow.  
- Label whether the force was a push or a pull.  
- Use the word bank provided to complete the sentence describing how the object moved.

**Word Bank:** pushed | pulled | away from | towards

```
I ___ the ___ so it moved ___ me.
```

## Section 11: Elaborate – Action Word Cards (Optional Extension)  
**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
Students select four action words from the sorting activity and create cards that show how each word represents a push or a pull. They draw an arrow to show the direction of movement and label the picture to show the force.

**Instructions:**  
Select four of the action words from the sorting activity to complete the cards.

- Record the action.  
- Draw a picture showing the action.  
- Label it as a push or a pull.  
- Draw an arrow to show the direction of the force.
