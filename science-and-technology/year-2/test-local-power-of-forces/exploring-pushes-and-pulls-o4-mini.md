# Lesson: Exploring Pushes and Pulls

**URL:** https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6280-exploring-pushes-and-pulls  
**Lesson Name:** Exploring pushes and pulls  
**Focus Question:** What makes things move?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary “push”, “pull”, “towards” and “away from” in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Introduction  
Show students the cover image (three children playing on grass—one pulls a wagon, another pushes, another rides).  Ask the focus question, **“What makes things move?”**  Have them recall everyday examples (toys, vehicles). Document responses to gauge prior understanding and identify misconceptions.

## Section 1: Engage – Sledding Teamwork (5 minutes)

**Activity**  
Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.

<Instruction Box, centred>  
> Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word “force” here.

**Questions & Suggested Answers**  
1. **How did they get the sled to move?**  
   *Suggested answer:*  
   “The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.”

2. **Why is it called _Sledding Teamwork_?**  
   *Suggested answer:*  
   “They needed more than one person to make the sled move.”

## Section 2: Explore – Objects at Rest and in Motion (5 minutes)

**Activity**  
Watch three short videos and discuss how each object starts to move:
- Children tugging a rope (game)
- A child pedalling a bike with adult assistance
- A woman pushing a dog stroller

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

**Questions & Suggested Answers**  
1. **Why is the rope moving?**  
   “The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.”

2. **What is making the bike move?**  
   “The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.”

3. **What is making the pram move?**  
   “The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.”

## Section 3: Explain – Using Arrows to Show Force Direction (5 minutes)

**Activity**  
Examine pictures showing forces in action. Note each arrow’s direction and decide if it’s a push or a pull.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction of movement.

## Section 4: Explain – Classifying Forces as Pushes or Pulls (5 minutes)

**Activity**  
Interact with the on-screen sorting activity to classify each scenario as a **push** or a **pull**.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are called forces. Forces make objects move. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.

> It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, “push” and “pull” are introduced as nouns as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as “Pull the car seat belt” they are used as verbs.

---

## Section 5: Explain – Directional Language (15 minutes)

**Activity**  
Complete the sentences using the words provided: **push**, **pull**, **towards**, **away from**.

1. **Sentence 1:**  
   I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.

2. **Sentence 2:**  
   I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ ___ me.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that pushing an object causes it to move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements before completing the sentences.

**Answers**  
1. I **pull** the suitcase so it moves **towards** me.  
2. I **push** the trolley so it moves **away from** me.

## Section 6: Elaborate – Forces Charades (Class or Pairs)

**Activity**  
Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.

<Instruction Box>  
> Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.

**How to play:**  
- Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
- Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
- Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students consolidate their understanding by playing *Forces Charades*, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess. Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasize how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

---

## Section 7: Elaborate – Brainstorming Examples (Class)

**Activity**  
As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull, or both to make something move. Document responses on the board.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body, or with something like a stick or a bat. They work together to brainstorm everyday activities that require a push, a pull, or both, considering how each action moves objects.

## Section 8: Consolidate – Identifying Pushes and Pulls in Pictures (10 minutes)

**Activity**  
Look at each picture and the arrow indicating force direction. Complete the multiple-choice questions: _Push or Pull?_

1. A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil.  
2. Two stick figures: one helping the other climb by pulling up.  
3. A silhouetted figure pulls a box with a rope.  
4. A hand pressing down on a button.  
5. A figure pushing a large box.  
6. A hand pulling down a blackout blind.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine the pictures and decide if each one is a push or a pull.

**Answers**  
1. Push  
2. Pull  
3. Pull  
4. Push  
5. Push  
6. Pull

## Section 9: Elaborate – Action Word Sort (15 minutes)

**Activity**  
Act out the verbs on the tiles and sort them into the correct group: **Push** or **Pull**.

_Words:_ shove, stretch, throw, tug, press, tow, drag, close

**Teaching Notes**  
Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into push and pull.

**Answers**  
- **Push** words: shove, press, throw, close  
- **Pull** words: tug, stretch, tow, drag

## Section 10: Elaborate – Non-living Forces (10 minutes)

**Activity**  
Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects using a push or a pull.

**Example Responses**  
- The weather: wind or rain can push or pull objects such as leaves, balls and trees.  
- Water: a river can push or pull objects along it.  
- Trucks and diggers can push and pull objects.  
- Robots and games that use mechanical parts to push and pull.

## Section 11: Evaluate – Investigation of Pushes and Pulls (15 minutes)

**Activity**  
Investigate how things move:

1. Choose three things to investigate.  
2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
3. Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used.  
4. Label whether it was a push or a pull.  
5. Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank: **push**, **pull**, **towards**, **away from**.

**Teaching Notes**  
- Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model how to record their results.  
- This activity provides an opportunity for informal assessment of each student’s ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**Worked Example**  
> I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.

_(Student responses will vary; use this framework for assessment.)_

## Lesson Conclusion  
Revisit the focus question: **What makes things move?** Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any remaining misconceptions.  

**Assessment Task**  
Students draw pictures of each object in motion, use an arrow to show the direction of the force, label whether it was a push or a pull, and complete sentences describing how each object moved using the word bank.
