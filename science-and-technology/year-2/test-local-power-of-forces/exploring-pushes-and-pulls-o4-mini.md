## Focus Question  
**What makes things move?**

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary *push*, *pull*, *towards* and *away from* in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the cover image and ask the focus question:  
> *What makes things move?*  

Ask students to recall everyday examples of movement (toys, vehicles, wind) and record their responses to gauge prior understanding.

### 1. Engage: Sledding Teamwork Video and Discussion  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word 'force' here.

**Activity Components:**  
- Instruction Box (centered blue border):  
  “Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.”  
- Video: *Sledding Teamwork*  
- Two discussion prompts displayed side by side in boxes:

  **Column 1 (left):**  
  **Question:**  
  > How did they get the sled to move?  
  **Response Types:** text, draw, upload  

  **Column 2 (right):**  
  **Question:**  
  > Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?  
  **Response Types:** text, draw, upload  

**Student Answers:**  
- How did they get the sled to move?  
  **Answer:**  
  > The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
- Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?  
  **Answer:**  
  > They needed more than one person to make the sled move.

---

### 2. Explore: Objects at Rest and Motion Videos  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

**Activity Components:**  
- Statement Box (purple border):  
  “Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.”  
- Three columns, each with a video or animation plus a discussion prompt:

  1. **Column 1:**  
     - Animation/Image alt text: “Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.”  
     - **Question:**  
       > Why is the rope moving?  
     - **Response Types:** text, draw, upload  
     - **Answer:**  
       > The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.

  2. **Column 2:**  
     - Animation/Image alt text: “A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.”  
     - **Question:**  
       > What is making the bike move?  
     - **Response Types:** text, draw, upload  
     - **Answer:**  
       > The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.

  3. **Column 3:**  
     - Animation/Image alt text: “A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.”  
     - **Question:**  
       > What is making the pram move?  
     - **Response Types:** text, draw, upload  
     - **Answer:**  
       > The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.

### 3. Explain: Arrows to Show Forces  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students observe how **arrows** can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine the pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction of movement.

**Activity Components:**  
- Statement Box (purple border):  
  “We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.”  
- Instruction Box (no border):  
  “Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?”  
- Six boxed images arranged in two rows of three, each with “Push or pull?” prompt:

  1. **Image alt:** “A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil, arrow indicating direction of force.”  
     **Answer:** Push  

  2. **Image alt:** “Two stick figures: one helping the other climb from a lower platform by pulling up. An arrow indicates direction of force.”  
     **Answer:** Pull  

  3. **Image alt:** “A silhouetted figure pulls a box towards them with a rope. An arrow indicates direction of force.”  
     **Answer:** Pull  

  4. **Image alt:** “A hand pressing down on a button with an arrow indicating the direction of force.”  
     **Answer:** Push  

  5. **Image alt:** “A figure pushing a large box, with an arrow indicating direction of force.”  
     **Answer:** Push  

  6. **Image alt:** “A hand pulling down a blackout blind with a red arrow indicating the direction of force.”  
     **Answer:** Pull

### 4. Explain: Pushes and Pulls as Forces  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.  

> It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, ‘push’ and ‘pull’ are introduced as nouns as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as ‘Pull the car seat belt’ they are used as verbs.

**Activity Components:**  
- Statement Box (purple border):  
  “**Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.”  
- Interactive classification (cards to drag into “Push” or “Pull”).  
- Instruction Box (no border):  
  “Decide if each force is a push or a pull.”

_No fixed student responses; use whole-class discussion._

### 5. Elaborate: Action Word Sorting  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into push and pull.

**Activity Components:**  
- Plain Text (statement):  
  “Many action words are used to describe forces.”  
- Interactive response: categorise eight word-tiles under “Push” or “Pull.”  
- Instructions (centered):  
  “Act out the words on the tiles and then sort them into the correct group.”

  **Tiles:** shove, throw, press, close, tug, stretch, tow, drag  
  **Categories:** Push | Pull  

**Answer:**  
- Push words: shove, press, throw and close.  
- Pull words: tug, stretch, tow and drag.

---

### 6. Elaborate: Action Word Cards  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students select four action words from the previous slide and create cards that show how each word represents a push or a pull. They draw an arrow to show the direction of movement and label the picture to show the force.

**Activity Components:**  
- Instruction Box (blue border):  
  “Select four of the action words from the sorting activity to complete the cards.”  
- Bullet-list instructions:  
  - Record the action.  
  - Draw a picture showing the action.  
  - Label it as a push or a pull.  
  - Draw an arrow to show the direction of the force.

_No fixed student responses; students design their own cards._

### 7. Explore & Explain: Directional Language and Sentences  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements before using the provided words to complete the sentences.

**Activity Components:**  
- Statement Box (purple border):  
  “When we push an object, it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.”  
- Fill-in-the-blank Sentence 1 (with image):  
  **Image alt:** “A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.”  
  **Sentence:** “I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.”  
  **Answer:**  
  - First blank: pull  
  - Second blank: towards  

- Fill-in-the-blank Sentence 2 (with image):  
  **Image alt:** “A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags.”  
  **Sentence:** “I ___ the trolley so it moved ___ me.”  
  **Answer:**  
  - First blank: push  
  - Second blank: away from

### 8. Consolidate: Forces Charades  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students consolidate their understanding by playing *Forces Charades*, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess. Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasise how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

**Activity Components:**  
- Instruction Box (no border):  
  “Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.”  
- How to play (orange box):  
  - Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
  - Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
  - Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.  
- Example speech-bubble (grey):  
  *I pull the rope so it moves towards me.*  
- Image alt: “A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war.”  
- Coloured boxes for key words: pull, push, towards, away from.

_No fixed student responses; free-form performance and language use._

### 9. Evaluate: Investigating Forces  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.  

> This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**Activity Components:**  
- Coloured Box (orange):  
  “Investigate how things move.”  
- Instruction Box (blue border): bullet list:  
  1. Choose three things to investigate.  
  2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
  3. Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.  
  4. Label if it was a push or a pull.  
  5. Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.  
- Two-column layout:  
  - **Left column:** Teacher’s worked example:  
    - Image alt: “Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.”  
    - Plain Text: “I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.”  
  - **Right column:** Student investigation area:  
    - Word Bank box listing: pushed | pulled | away from | towards  
    - Three draw-and-label boxes: Object 1, Object 2, Object 3  
    - Three fill-in-the-blank sentences under each drawing:  
      > “I ___ the ___ so it moved ___ me.”  
    - *(No fixed answers; students record their own observations.)*

### 10. Elaborate: Non-living Forces Examples  
**Teaching Notes:**  
> Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling.

**Activity Components:**  
- Statement Box (purple border):  
  “Objects can be pushed and pulled by living and non-living things.”  
- Draw prompt: two blank white squares side by side.  
  **Instructions (left-aligned):**  
  > Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling.  
  > Draw and label them to show how they move something.  

**Example Student Answer (one possibility):**  
- The weather: wind or rain can push or pull objects such as leaves, balls and trees.  
- Water: a river can push or pull objects along it.  
- Trucks and diggers can push and pull objects.  
- Robots and games that use mechanical parts to push and pull.
