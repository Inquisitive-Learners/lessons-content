# Forces

## Lesson Name  
Forces

## Focus Question  
**What makes things move?**

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us; when we pull an object it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary *push*, *pull*, *towards* and *away from* in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold**.

# Introduction  
Show students the cover image (alt text: “Three children play on grass. One pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it from behind while another sits inside, smiling.”) and ask:  
> **What makes things move?**

# Activities

## 1. Sledding Teamwork (Engage)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Instructions:**  
Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word “force” here.

**Questions & Example Answers:**  
1. **How did they get the sled to move?**  
   “The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.”  
2. **Why is it called _Sledding Teamwork_?**  
   “They needed more than one person to make the sled move.”

## 2. Objects at Rest (Explore)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Statement:**  
> Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.

**Materials (images/animations):**  
- Children tugging a rope in a game (alt text: “Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.”)  
- A child riding a bike (alt text: “A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.”)  
- A woman pushing a dog stroller (alt text: “A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.”)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. They watch three examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

**Questions & Example Answers:**  
- **Why is the rope moving?**  
  “The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.”  
- **What is making the bike move?**  
  “The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.”  
- **What is making the pram move?**  
  “The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.”

## 3. What Are Forces? (Explain)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Statement:**  
> Pushes and pulls are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.

**Activity:**  
Interactive online sorting—classify each example as a push or a pull.

**Instructions:**  
Decide if each force shown is a push or a pull.

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces. They share and explain their classifications.

## 4. Direction of Force (Explain)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Statement:**  
> We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.

**Instructions:**  
Look at each picture and the direction of the arrow. Is it a push or a pull?

| Picture (alt text) | Push or Pull? | Correct Answer |
|---|---|---|
| A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil, arrow indicating direction of force. | Push or pull? | Push |
| Two stick figures: one helping the other climb up by pulling. Arrow shows direction. | Push or pull? | Pull |
| A silhouetted figure pulls a box towards them with a rope; arrow indicates direction. | Push or pull? | Pull |
| A hand pressing down on a button with an arrow indicating the direction of force. | Push or pull? | Push |
| A figure pushing a large box, with an arrow indicating direction of force. | Push or pull? | Push |
| A hand pulling down a blackout blind with a red arrow indicating the direction of force. | Push or pull? | Pull |

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students observe how arrows show the direction of a force and use that to determine push versus pull.

## 5. Push and Pull Vocabulary (Explore & Explain)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Statement:**  
> When we push an object it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object it moves **towards** us.

### Activity A: Fill in the Blanks  
1. Sentence 1:  
   > I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.  
   - Correct fill: **pull** / **towards**  
   - Image: A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.  
2. Sentence 2:  
   > I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ ___ me.  
   - Correct fill: **push** / **away** / **from**  
   - Image: A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags.

### Word Bank  
- push  
- pull  
- away from  
- towards

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that pushing sends an object away; pulling brings it closer. They may act out before completing the sentences.

## 6. Brainstorming Forces (Explore)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Instructions:**  
As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.  
*Example:* Opening and closing a door.

**Statement:**  
> To push or pull an object, we usually touch it with our hands, another part of our body, or with something like a stick or a bat.

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students generate everyday examples of pushes and pulls, considering how each action causes movement.
