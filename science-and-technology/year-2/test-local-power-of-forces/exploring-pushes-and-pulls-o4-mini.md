Focus Question  
> **What makes things move?**

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

*(Teaching Sequence: “Students are learning to: Identify a force as a push or a pull.” — category: intention)*

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary “push”, “pull”, “towards” and “away from” in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
> A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
> A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
> Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
> Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Lesson Introduction  
Show students the cover image and ask the focus question, **“What makes things move?”** Have them recall everyday examples of movement such as toys and vehicles, helping them connect to their own experiences. Document and use students’ responses to gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.  

_Image (cover): “Three children play on grass. One pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it from behind while another sits inside, smiling.”_

## 1. Engage  
### Section: “Sledding Teamwork” (Teacher)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word ‘force’ here.  

### Activities  
1. **Instruction**  
   - *Watch the video* _Sledding Teamwork_ *and then answer the questions.*  
2. **Video**  
   - Video stimulus of children sledding (ID 11362).  
3. **Discussion Questions** (in two side-by-side boxes)  
   - **How did they get the sled to move?**  
     - *Responses may include:*  
       - The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward.  
       - The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
     - **Suggested Answer:**  
       > The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
   - **Why is it called _Sledding Teamwork_?**  
     - *Responses may include:*  
       - They needed more than one person to make the sled move.

## 2. Explore  
### Section: “Objects Need a Push or Pull” (Teacher)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

### Activities  
1. **Statement**  
   > Things can’t move by themselves.  
   > An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.  
2. **Three-Column Layout**  
   - **Column 1:**  
     - **Discussion:** Why is the rope moving?  
       - **Suggested Answer:**  
         > The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.  
     - **Animation Preview / Image:**  
       - Alt text: “Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.”  
   - **Column 2:**  
     - **Discussion:** What is making the bike move?  
       - **Suggested Answer:**  
         > The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.  
     - **Animation Preview / Image:**  
       - Alt text: “A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.”  
   - **Column 3:**  
     - **Discussion:** What is making the pram move?  
       - **Suggested Answer:**  
         > The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.  
     - **Animation Preview / Image:**  
       - Alt text: “A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.”

## 3. Explain – Part 1  
### Section: “Forces Are Pushes & Pulls” (Teacher Interactive)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are called **forces** and that forces make objects move. Forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, ‘push’ and ‘pull’ are introduced as nouns as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as ‘Pull the car seat belt’ they are used as verbs.

### Activities  
1. **Statement**  
   > **Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.  
2. **Interactive Sort**  
   - Students classify a series of on-screen scenarios as a push or a pull by dragging items into two groups.  
3. **Instruction**  
   > Decide if each force is a push or a pull.

## 4. Explain – Part 2  
### Section: “Showing Direction with Arrows” (Student)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students observe how **arrows** can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine the pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction of movement.

### Activities  
1. **Statement**  
   > We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.  
2. **Six-Box Grid of Images**  
   For each picture, students select **Push** or **Pull**.

### Section: “Pushing Moves Away, Pulling Moves Towards”  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move **away** from us, while pulling an object causes it to move **towards** us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements, before using the provided words to complete the sentences.

### Activities  
1. **Statement**  
   > When we push an object, it moves **away** from us.  
   > When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.  
2. **Sentence 1**  
   - “I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.”  
   - **Image:**  
     - Alt text: “A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.”  
   - **Word Bank (coloured):** push, pull, away from, towards  
   - **Answers:** “I **pull** the suitcase so it moves **towards** me.”  
3. **Sentence 2**  
   - “I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ me.”  
   - **Image:**  
     - Alt text: “A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags.”  
   - **Word Bank (coloured):** push, pull, away from, towards  
   - **Answers:** “I **push** the trolley so it moves **away from** me.”  

4. **Instruction**  
   > Use the words to complete the sentences.
