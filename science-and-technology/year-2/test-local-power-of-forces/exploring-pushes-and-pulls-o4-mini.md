## Focus Question  
**What makes things move?**

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary _push_, _pull_, _towards_ and _away from_ in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, _“What makes things move?”_ Have them recall everyday examples of movement such as toys and vehicles, helping them connect to their own experiences. Document and use students' responses to gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

# Teaching Sequence

---

## Section 1 (Teacher) — Engage (5 min)  
**Activity:**  
Watch the video _Sledding Teamwork_ and then answer the questions.

**Teaching Notes (Engage):**  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word “force” here.

**Questions & Answers:**  
1. **How did they get the sled to move?**  
   _Suggested Answer:_ The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
2. **Why is it called _Sledding Teamwork_?**  
   _Suggested Answer:_ They needed more than one person to make the sled move.

---

## Section 2 (Teacher) — Explore (5 min)  
**Statement:**  
Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.

**Activity:**  
Watch three short demonstrations showing forces in action. For each: discuss the question.

**Teaching Notes (Explore):**  
Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.                                  | Why is the rope moving?          | The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.                                                  |
| A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.                       | What is making the bike move?    | The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.  |
| A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.                            | What is making the pram move?    | The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.                                          |

## Section 3 (Teacher) — Explore & Explain (5 min)  
**Statement:**  
**Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.

**Activity:**  
Use the interactive component to classify each example as a push or a pull.

**Teaching Notes (Explore/Explain):**  
Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.

_It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, “push” and “pull” are introduced as nouns as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as “Pull the car seat belt” they are used as verbs._

**Instruction:**  
Decide if each force is a push or a pull.

## Section 4 (Student) — Explore/Explain (15 min)  
### Part A: Push vs Pull Sentences  
**Statement:**  
When we push an object, it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.

**Activity:**  
Complete the sentences using the word bank and the pictures:  
1. Sentence 1: “I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.”  
2. Sentence 2: “I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ me.”

**Teaching Notes (Explore/Explain):**  
Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements before using the provided words to complete the sentences.

**Answers:**  
1. I **pull** the suitcase so it moves **towards** me.  
2. I **push** the trolley so it moves **away from** me.

### Subsection 4.1: Forces Charades  
**Activity:**  
Play _Forces Charades_ as a class or in pairs.

**How to play:**  
- Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
- Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
- Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

> *I pull the rope so it moves towards me.*

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate):**  
Students consolidate their understanding by playing _Forces Charades_, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess. Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasise how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

---

### Subsection 4.2: Brainstorm Activities  
**Activity:**  
As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate):**  
Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat.

---

## Section 5 (Student) — Explain (5 min)  
**Statement:**  
We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.

**Activity:**  
Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?

**Teaching Notes (Explain):**  
Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine the pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction of movement.

| Picture (alt text)                                                                                       | Push or Pull? | Answer  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|
| A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil, arrow indicating direction of force.       |              | **Push** |
| Two stick figures: one helping the other climb from a lower platform by pulling up. Arrow indicates force. |              | **Pull** |
| A silhouetted figure pulls a box towards them with a rope. Arrow indicates force.                         |              | **Pull** |
| A hand pressing down on a button with an arrow indicating the direction of force.                         |              | **Push** |
| A figure pushing a large box, with an arrow indicating direction of force.                                |              | **Push** |
| A hand pulling down a blackout blind with a red arrow indicating the direction of force.                  |              | **Pull** |

## Section 6 (Teacher) — Evaluate (15 min)  
**Activity:**  
Investigate how things move.

**Instructions:**  
1. Choose three things to investigate.  
2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
3. Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.  
4. Label if it was a push or a pull.  
5. Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.

**Teaching Notes (Evaluate):**  
- Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.  
- This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**Worked Example:**  
- *Illustration:* Hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.  
- *Example Sentence:* “I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.”

---

### Subsection 6.1 (Student) — Investigation Recording  
**Activity:**  
1. Draw **Object 1**, **Object 2**, **Object 3** in motion, showing an arrow for the force direction.  
2. For each, complete the sentence: “I ___ the ___ so it moved ___ me.”  
3. Use the word bank (pushed, pulled, away from, towards).

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw a picture of each object in motion, using an arrow to show the direction of the force. They label whether the force was a push or a pull, and use the word bank to complete sentences that describe how each object moved.

**Answers:**  
Varied; based on students’ chosen objects.

## Section 7 (Student) — Elaborate (15 min)  
**Statement:**  
Many action words are used to describe forces.

**Activity 1:**  
Act out the words on the tiles and then sort them into the correct group (Push / Pull).

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate):**  
Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into push and pull.

**Answers:**  
- **Push words:** shove, press, throw, close  
- **Pull words:** tug, stretch, tow, drag  

---

### Subsection 7.1: Action Word Cards  
**Activity 2:**  
Select four of the action words from the sorting activity to complete the cards.  
- Record the action.  
- Draw a picture showing the action.  
- Label it as a push or a pull.  
- Draw an arrow to show the direction of the force.

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students select four action words from the previous slide and create cards that show how each word represents a push or a pull. They draw an arrow to show the direction of movement and label the picture to show the force.

**Answers:**  
Varied; based on students’ chosen words.

---

## Section 8 (Student) — Elaborate (10 min)  
**Statement:**  
Objects can be pushed and pulled by living and non-living things.

**Activity:**  
Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling.  
Draw and label them to show how they move something.

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate):**  
Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling.

**Suggested Examples:**  
- The weather: wind or rain can push or pull objects such as leaves, balls and trees.  
- Water: a river can push or pull objects along it.  
- Trucks and diggers can push and pull objects.  
- Robots and games that use mechanical parts to push and pull.
