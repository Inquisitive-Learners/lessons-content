# Lesson: Power of Forces

**Focus Question:** What makes things move?

---

## Lesson Introduction

**Introduction**  
Show students the image of three children playing on grass (one pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes from behind, a third sits inside). Ask: **What makes things move?** Document and use students' responses to gauge their current understanding.

**Learning Intention**  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

*(from intention)*

**Success Criteria**  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us. When we pull an object, it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary **push**, **pull**, **towards** and **away from** in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a scientific investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

*(from success-criteria)*

**Teacher Reading**  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

*(from teacher-knowledge)*

**Note**  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. These vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Section 1: Sledding Teamwork (Engage)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word "force" here.

**Activity**  
1. Instruction Box:  
   *Watch the video* _Sledding Teamwork_ *and then answer the questions.*  
2. Video: _Sledding Teamwork_  
3. Discussion Questions (response types: text, draw, upload):  
   - **How did they get the sled to move?**  
     *Suggested Answer:*  
     The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
   - **Why is it called** _Sledding Teamwork?_  
     *Suggested Answer:*  
     They needed more than one person to make the sled move.

## Section 2: Objects in Motion (Explore)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay still unless it is made to move. They watch three videos showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

**Statement Box**  
Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.

**Videos & Discussion**  
1. **Rope**  
   - *Rive Animation Image Alt:* Children tugging a rope in a game, smiling outdoors in a grassy area.  
   - **Why is the rope moving?**  
     *Suggested Answer:* The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.

2. **Bike**  
   - *Rive Animation Image Alt:* A child in a helmet smiles as they ride a bike, with a woman accompanying them.  
   - **What is making the bike move?**  
     *Suggested Answer:* The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.

3. **Pram**  
   - *Rive Animation Image Alt:* A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller through a park with trees.  
   - **What is making the pram move?**  
     *Suggested Answer:* The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.

## Section 3: Forces Defined (Explore/Explain)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are called forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain the reason for each classification to demonstrate their understanding.

> *It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, “push” and “pull” are introduced as nouns as students sort the cards into two groups. However, in examples such as “Pull the car seat belt” they are used as verbs.*

**Statement Box**  
**Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.

**Interactive Activity**  
- Classify each scenario as a **push** or a **pull**.

**Instruction Box**  
Decide if each force is a push or a pull.

## Section 4: Direction of Forces (Explain)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine pictures showing forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction of movement.

**Statement Box**  
We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.

**Activity**  
Examine each image and select **Push** or **Pull**.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| A worker in a hard hat pushes a wheelbarrow filled with soil, arrow indicating direction of force.                  | Push   |
| Two stick figures: one helping the other climb from a lower platform by pulling up. An arrow indicates direction.   | Pull   |
| A silhouetted figure pulls a box towards them with a rope. An arrow indicates direction of force.                   | Pull   |
| A hand pressing down on a button with an arrow indicating the direction of force.                                    | Push   |
| A figure pushing a large box, with an arrow indicating direction of force.                                           | Push   |
| A hand pulling down a blackout blind with a red arrow indicating the direction of force.                            | Pull   |

## Section 5: Movement Direction (Explain)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move **away** from us, while pulling an object causes it to move **towards** us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements before using the provided words to complete the sentences.

**Statement Box**  
When we push an object it moves **away** from us. When we pull an object it moves **towards** us.

**Activity: Fill in the Blanks**

1. **Sentence 1:**  
   I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.  
   - Image Alt Text: A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase against a pale background.  
   - **Answers:** pull; towards  

2. **Sentence 2:**  
   I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ me.  
   - Image Alt Text: A young girl in a pink dress smiles while pushing a shopping trolley with colourful bags.  
   - **Answers:** push; away from

## Section 6: Brainstorming Pushes and Pulls (Explore)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body, or with something like a stick or a bat. They work together to brainstorm everyday activities that require a push, a pull or both, considering how each action moves objects.

**Instruction Box**  
As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.

**Statement Box**  
To push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat.

## Section 7: Forces Charades (Elaborate)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students consolidate their understanding by playing *Forces Charades*, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess. Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasise how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

**Instruction Box**  
Play _Forces Charades_ as a class or in pairs.

**How to Play:**  
- Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
- Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
- Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

**Example (Statement Box):**  
*I pull the rope so it moves towards me.*

**Image Alt Text:**  
A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war.

## Section 8: Action Word Sort (Elaborate)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into **Push** and **Pull**.

**Instruction Box**  
Act out the words on the tiles and then sort them into the correct group.

**Categories & Items**  
- **Push**: shove; throw; press; close  
- **Pull**: tug; stretch; tow; drag  

*Suggested Answer:*  
Push words: shove, press, throw and close.  
Pull words: tug, stretch, tow and drag.

## Section 9: Action Word Cards (Elaborate)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students select four action words from the sorting activity to complete the cards by showing how each word represents a push or a pull.

**Instruction Box**  
Select four of the action words from the sorting activity to complete the cards.

**Steps:**  
1. Record the action.  
2. Draw a picture showing the action.  
3. Label it as a push or a pull.  
4. Draw an arrow to show the direction of the force.

**Template Image Alt Text:** Four blank boxes with space to write an action word and to draw and label a picture.

## Section 10: Investigating Forces (Evaluate)

**Teaching Notes**  
Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.

**Coloured Box**  
Investigate how things move.

**Instruction Box**  
- Choose three things to investigate.  
- Use a force to make each thing move.  
- Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.  
- Label if it was a push or a pull.  
- Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.

**Example**  
- Image Alt Text: Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.  
- Plain Text: _I pushed the ball so it moved away from me._

## Section 12: Extending to Non-living Forces (Elaborate/Differentiate)

**Teaching Notes**  
Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling.

**Statement Box**  
Objects can be pushed and pulled by living and non-living things.

**Activity**  
Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.

**Suggested Answers:**  
- The weather: wind or rain can push or pull objects such as leaves, balls and trees.  
- Water: a river can push or pull objects along it.  
- Trucks and diggers can push and pull objects.  
- Robots and games that use mechanical parts to push and pull.
