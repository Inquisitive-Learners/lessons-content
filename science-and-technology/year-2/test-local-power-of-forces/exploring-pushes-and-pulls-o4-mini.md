## Focus Question  
**What makes things move?**

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify a force as a push or a pull.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
- Know that when we push an object it moves away from us; when we pull an object it moves towards us.  
- Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
- Use the vocabulary *push*, *pull*, *towards* and *away from* in compound sentences to describe forces.  
- Conduct a simple investigation collecting and representing data around the cause and effect of pushing and pulling.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces**  
A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.

**Pushes and pulls**  
A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer. These actions help distinguish the different ways objects can start, stop or change how they move.

**Direction of forces**  
Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts. Visualising forces like this can help you pinpoint how an object is set in motion.

**Objects and movement**  
Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.

## Activity 1: Sledding Teamwork (Engage)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Engage)**  
> Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word “force” here.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Instruction Box: *Watch the video* _Sledding Teamwork_ *and then answer the questions.*  
2. Play the video.  
3. Pose two questions in parallel columns:  
   - **How did they get the sled to move?**  
     • Students respond (text/drawing/upload).  
     • Example answer: “The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.”  
   - **Why is it called* Sledding Teamwork*?**  
     • Students respond.  
     • Example answer: “They needed more than one person to make the sled move.”

## Activity 2: Objects at Rest (Explore)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Explore)**  
> Students explore the idea that objects cannot move on their own. An object at rest will stay at rest unless something causes it to move. They watch three short clips showing examples of pushing and pulling and discuss how each object is set in motion.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Show Statement Box:  
   > Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.  
2. Arrange three side-by-side animations (columns):  
   - Children tugging a rope  
     • Question: **Why is the rope moving?**  
       – Example answer: “The rope is moving because the children are pulling it.”  
   - Child pedaling a bike  
     • Question: **What is making the bike move?**  
       – Example answer: “The bike is moving because the child is pushing down on the pedals. The lady is also pushing it along.”  
   - Woman pushing a pram  
     • Question: **What is making the pram move?**  
       – Example answer: “The dog is moving because the woman is pushing it in the pram.”

## Activity 3: Directional Arrows (Explain)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Explain)**  
> Students observe how arrows can be used to show the direction of a force. They examine pictures of forces in action and decide if each one is a push or a pull by noting the arrow’s direction.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Display Statement Box:  
   > We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.  
2. Instruction Box: *Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?*  
3. Six multiple-choice items (list display):  
   - Wheelbarrow being moved by a worker → **Push**  
   - Stick-figure helping another climb → **Pull**  
   - Silhouette pulling a box with a rope → **Pull**  
   - Hand pressing a button → **Push**  
   - Figure pushing a large box → **Push**  
   - Hand pulling down a blind → **Pull**

## Activity 4: Forces Classification (Explore & Explain)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Explore & Explain)**  
> Students are introduced to the concept that pushes and pulls are types of forces that cause objects to move. They explore the interactive to classify each force as a push or a pull. Ask students to share their choices and explain their reasoning.

> It’s important to remember that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. In this interactive activity, ‘push’ and ‘pull’ are introduced as nouns as students sort cards into two groups. However, in examples such as ‘Pull the car seat belt’ they are used as verbs.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Display Statement Box:  
   > Pushes and pulls are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.  
2. Launch the interactive sorting activity.  
3. Have students drag examples into the *Push* or *Pull* column.  
4. Facilitate a brief share-out: “Why did you place that item in Push/Pull?”

## Activity 5: Action Words (Elaborate)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
> Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios. They act out and sort the provided verbs into push and pull.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Display plain text:  
   > Many action words are used to describe forces.  
2. Interactive response categorise:  
   - Instructions: *Act out the words on the tiles and then sort them into the correct group.*  
   - Tiles to sort (text only)  
     - Push category: *shove*, *throw*, *press*, *close*  
     - Pull category: *tug*, *stretch*, *tow*, *drag*

## Activity 6: Non-living Force Examples (Elaborate)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Elaborate)**  
> Students draw and label two non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Instruction Box:  
   > Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.  
2. Provide two blank drawing squares.  
3. Encourage students to label each drawing with an arrow showing force direction and note “push” or “pull.”  
   - **Example**: Wind pushing leaves; water pushing a boat downstream.

## Activity 7: Push vs Pull Directions (Explore & Explain)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Explore & Explain)**  
> Students are introduced to the key concept that pushing an object causes it to move away from us, while pulling an object causes it to move towards us. To reinforce this understanding, they consider the direction of movement when a suitcase is pulled and a trolley is pushed. It may be beneficial for students to act out these movements before completing sentences.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Display Statement Box (two paragraphs centered):  
   - *When we push an object, it moves* **away** *from us.*  
   - *When we pull an object, it moves* **towards** *us.*  
2. Show two images side by side (columns):  
   - Girl pulling a suitcase  
   - Girl pushing a trolley  
3. Instruction Box: *Use the words to complete the sentences.*  
4. Fill-in-the-blanks responses:  
   - **Sentence 1:** *I* ___ *the suitcase so it moves* ___ *me.*  
     - Answers: **pull**, **towards**  
   - **Sentence 2:** *I* ___ *the trolley so it moves* ___ *me.*  
     - Answers: **pushed**, **away from**  

### Sub-activity A: Brainstorm (Preparation)  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat. They work together to brainstorm everyday activities that require a push, a pull or both, considering how each action moves objects.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
- Whiteboard draw: list activities (e.g., opening/closing a door, rowing a boat, moving furniture).  

### Sub-activity B: Forces Charades (Consolidation)  
**Teaching Notes**  
> Students consolidate their understanding by playing *Forces Charades*, acting out a push or pull for classmates to guess. Guide students to use big gestures and direction to emphasise how each action moves objects. Have them use the word bank to verbally describe the force and how it makes the object move.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Instruction Box: *Play Forces Charades as a class or in pairs.*  
2. How to play (Coloured Box):  
   - Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
   - Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
   - Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

## Activity 8: Forces Investigation (Evaluate)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  

**Teaching Notes (Evaluate)**  
> Explain to students they will be using pushes or pulls to make three objects move. Use the provided worked example to model to students how they will record the results of their investigation.

> This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to identify a force as a push or a pull.

**Teacher-led Steps**  
1. Coloured Box (fEn5MLv664mF column):  
   > Investigate how things move.  
2. Instruction Box (1rhy83ic1MaH column):  
   1. Choose three things to investigate.  
   2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
   3. Draw each one, using an arrow to show the direction of the force you used to move it.  
   4. Label if it was a push or a pull.  
   5. Complete the sentence to describe what happened using words from the word bank.  
3. Example (further right column):  
   - Image of a hand pushing a ball with arrow.  
   - Plain Text: *Example*  
   - Plain Text: *I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.*  
4. Students then complete three draw-and-describe cycles, each followed by a fill-in-the-blanks sentence.
