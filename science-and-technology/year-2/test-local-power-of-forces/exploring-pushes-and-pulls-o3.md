# Lesson: Exploring Pushes and Pulls  
URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6280-exploring-pushes-and-pulls  

## Focus Question  
What makes things move?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify a force as a push or a pull.  *(Bagj3hW3H7aC)*

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
• Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
• Know that a push moves an object away from us, and a pull moves it towards us.  
• Use arrows to show the direction of a force.  
• Use the words ‘push’, ‘pull’, ‘towards’ and ‘away from’ in compound sentences.  
• Conduct a simple investigation that collects and represents data about pushing and pulling.  *(LTgDjxiZWzwM)*

## Teacher Reading *(Background knowledge – ai-bdUeZa3w5XKE)*  
**Forces** – A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction.  
**Pushes and pulls** – A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer.  
**Direction of forces** – We show direction with arrows.  
**Objects and movement** – Objects stay still until a force acts on them, and keep moving in the same direction until another force acts.

## Note *(Vocabulary – ehydPingR4J0)*  
The bold words in this lesson are low–frequency, subject-specific (Tier 2 and Tier 3) vocabulary. Teach them in context as you work through the activities.

## Introduction *(ai-x9ySnRD6sped)*  
Display the landscape image (alt text: *Three children play on grass. One pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it from behind while another sits inside, smiling.*). Ask:  
*What makes things move?*  
Record students’ ideas to reveal their current understanding and misconceptions.

# Activity Sequence  
(The order below follows the Sections Overview exactly, including all subsections.)

---

### 1. Watch and Wonder – “Sledding Teamwork”  
Section ID BmCVD3d3GiQY  |  Teacher page  |  Duration ≈ 5 min  

**What students do**  
1. Read the instruction box: *Watch the video **Sledding Teamwork** and then answer the questions.*  
2. Watch the video.  
3. Discuss and/or respond (text/draw/upload) to:  
   • *How did they get the sled to move?*  
   • *Why is it called **Sledding Teamwork**?*

**Teaching Notes** *(597hB5wiJ4S2 – Engage)*  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. They are **not** expected to use the word *force* yet.

**Suggested answers**  
• The woman pushed from behind and the man pulled from the front with a rope.  
• They needed more than one person working together to make the sled move.

### 2. Why Can’t Things Move by Themselves?  
Section ID tDP2z2N5cRVB  |  Teacher page  |  Duration ≈ 5 min  

**Content shown**  
Statement box:  
*Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.*

Three short looping animations with discussion-response prompts (arranged in columns):  

| Image & alt text | Question | Sample answer |
|---|---|---|
| Children tugging a rope – *Children tugging a rope in a game…* | *Why is the rope moving?* | The children are **pulling** the rope. |
| Child on a bike – *A child in a helmet smiles…* | *What is making the bike move?* | The child is **pushing** the pedals and an adult is helping push. |
| Dog stroller – *A woman in a red sweater pushing a dog stroller…* | *What is making the pram move?* | The woman is **pushing** the pram. |

**Teaching Notes** *(hgdzamcACfMf – Explore)*  
Objects cannot move on their own. Use the three examples to emphasise that a push or a pull is needed to set an object in motion.

---

### 3. Push or Pull? (Forces Interactive)  
Section ID A7jzeoMVSrWP  |  Teacher page  |  Duration ≈ 5 min  

**Content shown**  
Statement box: **Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.  
Interactive sorting activity – students decide if each illustrated force is a push or a pull.  
Instruction box: *Decide if each force is a push or a pull.*

**Teaching Notes** *(A4zsXbPtrx0F – Explore & Explain)*  
Reinforce that every force can be described as a push or a pull. After sorting, invite students to justify their choices.

---

### 4. Push ➜ Away Pull ➜ Towards  
Section ID a19q3Vs5B1JS  |  Student page  |  Duration ≈ 15 min  

**Content shown**  
Statement box explains ‘away’ vs ‘towards’.  
Two side-by-side images:  
• *A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase…*  
• *A young girl in a pink dress pushes a shopping trolley…*  

Students complete two fill-in-the-blank sentences:

1. “I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.”  
   • Answers: **pull / towards**

2. “I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ ___ ___ me.”  
   • Answers: **push / away / from**

Word bank (push, pull, away from, towards) provided.

**Teaching Notes** *(YM70wU6oSAMi – Explore & Explain)*  
Have students physically act out pulling a suitcase and pushing a trolley before writing. Emphasise the link between the type of force and the direction of movement.

#### 4a. Sub-section: Forces Charades  
Section ID xHUAwsspBJzv  |  Student sub-page (sort k)

Instruction box: *Play **Forces Charades** as a class or in pairs.*  

Coloured box (*How to play*):  
• Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
• Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
• Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.  

Speech bubble example: *“I pull the rope so it moves towards me.”*  

Image alt text: *A boy in a sweater poses confidently, imagining friends playing tug-of-war.*

Word bank tiles (pull, push, towards, away from).

**Teaching Notes** *(iFkSke0qHZFn)*  
Students act out a push or pull for classmates to guess, using big gestures and directional language.

---

#### 4b. Sub-section: Brainstorm – Push, Pull or Both  
Section ID KsXK5FwNWYRP  |  Student sub-page (sort c)

Image: *Whiteboard displaying the text: "Example: Opening and closing a door."*  

Instruction (info-box): *As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both.*  

Statement: *To push or pull an object, we usually touch it with our hands, another body part or something like a stick or a bat.*

**Teaching Notes** *(gcNXmYGKKWkG)*  
Guide discussion toward everyday actions (e.g., brushing teeth, rowing a boat) that involve pushes, pulls or both.

---

### 5. Using Arrows to Show Force Direction  
Section ID aKhLQg1JE2FR  |  Student page  |  Duration ≈ 5 min  

Statement box: *We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.*  
Instruction: *Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?*

Six picture-and-question tiles (multiple-choice). Answers are:

| Picture (alt text) | Correct answer |
|---|---|
| Worker pushes wheelbarrow | **Push** |
| Figure helps friend climb | **Pull** |
| Person pulls box with rope | **Pull** |
| Hand pressing button | **Push** |
| Figure pushing large box | **Push** |
| Hand pulling down a blind | **Pull** |

**Teaching Notes** *(62hWdwyK8JzH – Explain)*  
Show how the arrow tells us the direction. Students decide push or pull based only on the arrow.

### 6. Investigation Check-point – How Things Move  
Section ID NUmu2Qr1v1vu  |  Teacher page  |  Duration ≈ 15 min (Check-point)

Coloured box: *Investigate how things move.*  
Instruction steps (bullet list):  
1. Choose three things to investigate.  
2. Use a force to make each thing move.  
3. Draw each one, adding an arrow to show the direction of the force.  
4. Label if it was a push or a pull.  
5. Complete a sentence using the word bank.

Image example (alt): *Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.*  
Sentence example: “I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.”

**Teaching Notes**  
• *Worked example provided to model recording.* *(aNoGmE7mYtnv – Evaluate, worked-examples)*

### 7. Sorting Action Words – Push or Pull  
Section ID t5RALcDDFWSd  |  Student page  |  Duration ≈ 15 min  

Statement: *Many action words are used to describe forces.*  

Interactive categorise activity (B4jVW0rwkNtg). Tiles to sort:

Push → shove, throw, press, close  
Pull → stretch, tug, tow, drag

**Teaching Notes** *(GeeQiSq11Uvf – Elaborate)*  
Students mime each verb before sorting to help link the action to the meaning.

---

#### 7a. Sub-section: Action Word Cards  
Section ID VoaTH7XRVcKD  |  Student sub-page (sort k)

Instruction:  
• Select four action words from the sorting activity.  
• Write the word, draw the action, label it as push or pull, draw an arrow showing force direction.

Template image alt: *Four blank boxes with space to write an action word and to draw and label a picture.*

**Teaching Notes** *(hN0AL8KR000y)*  
Encourage clear arrows and labels so the type and direction of force are obvious.
