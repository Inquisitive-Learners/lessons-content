# Lesson: **Exploring Pushes and Pulls**  
URL: <https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6280-exploring-pushes-and-pulls>

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify a force as a push or a pull.  *(Bagj3hW3H7aC)*  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
2. Know that when we push an object it moves **away from** us and when we pull an object it moves **towards** us.  
3. Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
4. Use the vocabulary *push, pull, towards, away from* in compound sentences to describe forces.  
5. Conduct a scientific investigation, collecting and representing data about pushing and pulling.  *(LTgDjxiZWzwM)*  

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces** – A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction. Applying a greater force usually causes a bigger change in how an object moves.  

**Pushes and pulls** – A push moves an object away, while a pull brings it closer.  

**Direction of forces** – Forces have direction, often shown with arrows that indicate where the force is applied and which way it acts.  

**Objects and movement** – Objects stay still until a force makes them move. Once an object is moving, it keeps moving in the same direction unless another force acts on it.  *(ai-bdUeZa3w5XKE)*  

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words** – The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. They appear in **bold** within the lesson. *(ehydPingR4J0)*  

## Introduction (Teacher-led)  
Show students the cover image (alt text below) and ask: **What makes things move?**  Record students’ ideas to gauge current understanding. *(ai-x9ySnRD6sped)*  

Image alt text: “Three children play on grass. One pulls a wooden wagon, another pushes it from behind while another sits inside, smiling.”  

## Focus Question  
**What makes things move?**

---

## Activity Sequence  
All sections and subsections are listed in the exact order supplied in the lesson overview.

### 1. Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* (Section V – BmCVD3d3GiQY)

**Student view**  
> Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.  

**Sub-activities**  
1. “How did they get the sled to move?”  
2. “Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?”

**Teaching Notes** *(597hB5wiJ4S2 – Engage)*  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word **force** here.

**Answers**  
• The woman pushed the boy from behind, making the sled move forward. The man pulled the sled from the front using a rope.  
• They needed more than one person to make the sled move, so it was teamwork.

---

### 2. Why can’t things move by themselves? (Section k – tDP2z2N5cRVB)

Children view three short animations:

| Image (alt text) | Question for discussion |
|---|---|
| “Children tugging a rope in a game.” | “Why is the rope moving?” |
| “A child in a helmet rides a bike.” | “What is making the bike move?” |
| “A woman pushing a dog stroller.” | “What is making the pram move?” |

**Teaching Notes** *(hgdzamcACfMf – Explore)*  
Students explore that objects cannot move on their own. They discuss how each object is set in motion.

**Answers**  
• The rope is moving because the children are **pulling** it.  
• The bike moves because the child is **pushing** the pedals and the woman is **pushing** it along.  
• The dog is moving because the woman is **pushing** the pram.

---

### 3. Pushes, Pulls and Forces (Section o – A7jzeoMVSrWP)

**Key statement presented to students**  
> **Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.

Students use the interactive to decide if each force is a push or a pull.

**Teaching Notes** *(A4zsXbPtrx0F – Explore/Explain)*  
Reinforce that all forces can be described as either a push or a pull. Students sort cards into two groups and explain their choices.

*No fixed answers – responses are revealed by the interactive.*

---

### 4. Push = Away Pull = Towards  
(Section t – a19q3Vs5B1JS and its subsections)

#### 4a. Complete the sentences (Fill-in-the-blanks)  
| Picture (alt text) | Sentence & Answers |
|---|---|
| “A smiling girl in red leggings pulls a silver suitcase.” | **I [pull] the suitcase so it moves [towards] me.** |
| “A young girl in a pink dress pushes a shopping trolley.” | **I [push] the trolley so it moves [away] [from] me.** |

#### 4b. Word bank  
push pull away from towards  

#### 4c. Teaching Notes *(YM70wU6oSAMi – Explore/Explain)*  
Emphasise that pushing moves an object away and pulling moves it towards you. Encourage students to act out the movements before writing.

---

#### 4d. Forces Charades (Sub-section k – xHUAwsspBJzv)

Student instruction  
> Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.  

“How to play:”  
• Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
• Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
• Use the word bank to describe the force and how it makes an object move.

Teaching Notes *(iFkSke0qHZFn)*  
Guide students to use big gestures and directional language when acting.

*Open-ended – no fixed answers.*

---

#### 4e. Class brainstorm – Push, Pull or Both  
(Sub-section c – KsXK5FwNWYRP)

Student prompt (whiteboard image alt text):  
“Example: Opening and closing a door.”

Teaching Notes *(gcNXmYGKKWkG – Elaborate)*  
Students brainstorm everyday activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.

---

### 5. Using Arrows to Show Forces (Section u – aKhLQg1JE2FR)

Students look at each picture, note the arrow and choose **Push** or **Pull**.

| Image (alt text) | Correct answer |
|---|---|
| Worker pushing a wheelbarrow | Push |
| One figure helping another climb up | Pull |
| Person pulling a box with a rope | Pull |
| Hand pressing a button | Push |
| Figure pushing a large box | Push |
| Hand pulling down a blackout blind | Pull |

**Teaching Notes** *(62hWdwyK8JzH – Explain)*  
Students learn that arrows can show force direction and use them to decide if each action is a push or a pull.

---

### 6. Scientific Investigation – How Things Move  
(Section x – NUmu2Qr1v1vu and subsection V – sKMdmySUDHbZ)

**Checkpoint Activity** – Teacher-led modelling then student investigation.

Teacher modelling image alt text:  
“Illustration showing hands pushing a ball, with an arrow showing the direction of the force.”

Student tasks  
1. Choose three things to investigate.  
2. Use a force to make each move.  
3. Draw each object, add an arrow, label push or pull.  
4. Complete a sentence using the word bank (*pushed, pulled, away from, towards*).

Teaching Notes  
• *aNoGmE7mYtnv – Evaluate:* Model the worked example before students begin.  
• *6E405MdiYBUF – Assessment:* Use this as an informal assessment of students’ ability to identify a push or pull.  
• *q2jkKuryB44X – Activity description* summarises the student work.

*Open-ended – responses will vary.*

---

### 7. Action Words for Forces  
(Section y – t5RALcDDFWSd)

Students act out and sort verbs into Push / Pull groups.

**Word tiles and correct categories**  
*Push*: shove, press, throw, close  
*Pull*: tug, stretch, tow, drag  

Teaching Notes *(GeeQiSq11Uvf – Elaborate)*  
Students consider how many action words describe forces in everyday scenarios.

---

#### 7a. Action Word Cards  
(Sub-section k – VoaTH7XRVcKD)

Students select four words from the sort, complete a card for each and:

• Record the action word.  
• Draw a picture of the action.  
• Label it as push or pull.  
• Draw an arrow showing the direction of the force.

Teaching Notes *(hN0AL8KR000y)*  

*Open-ended – no fixed answers.*

---

### 8. Non-living Things that Move Objects  
(Section z – 2W50otiRE3Sz)

Student prompt (image alt text):  
“Two blank white squares with black outlines side by side.”

Instruction to students  
> Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.

**Teaching Notes** *(QPcNTow9P44n – Elaborate)*  

*Open-ended. Example answers might include:*  
• Wind pushing leaves.  
• A river pulling (carrying) sticks downstream.  

---

## Lesson Conclusion  

Revisit the focus question **“What makes things move?”** and invite students to share final ideas, addressing any remaining misconceptions. *(ai-n2J5XXUrX9HP)*
