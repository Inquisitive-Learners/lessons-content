# [Exploring Pushes and Pulls](https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6280-exploring-pushes-and-pulls)

## Focus Question  
**What makes things move?**

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Identify a force as a push or a pull.  

*(Source ID “Bagj3hW3H7aC” – keep for reference only.)*

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
• Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
• Know that when we push an object it moves **away from** us; when we pull an object it moves **towards** us.  
• Use directional arrows to show the way a force acts on an object.  
• Use the vocabulary *push, pull, towards,* and *away from* in compound sentences to describe forces.  
• Conduct a simple scientific investigation that collects and represents data about pushing and pulling.  

*(Source ID “LTgDjxiZWzwM”)*
  
## Teacher Reading  
**Forces** – A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction.  
**Pushes and pulls** – A push moves an object away; a pull brings it closer.  
**Direction of forces** – Arrows help students visualise where and how the force acts.  
**Objects and movement** – Objects remain still until a force moves them; they keep moving in the same direction unless another force acts.

## Note for Teachers  
The bold words throughout the lesson are Tier 2 & 3 vocabulary. Teach them within context to build content knowledge. *(Source ID “ehydPingR4J0”)*

## Lesson Flow  
The sections below follow the exact order supplied in the **Sections Overview** (including every sub-section).

### 1. Section BmCVD3d3GiQY – Engage  
**Instruction to students**  
“Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.”  

(Video plays here – no caption.)

**Activities (all within Activity ID “JKzTmQmmQhui”)**

| Sub-activity | Student prompt (exact wording) | Response type | Suggested answer |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| V | “How did they get the sled to move?” | text / draw / upload | “The woman pushed the boy from behind and the man pulled the sled with a rope.” |
| k | “Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?” | text / draw / upload | “They needed more than one person to make the sled move.” |

**Teaching Notes**  
*Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is being moved, introducing the idea of pushing and pulling. It is not expected that students understand or use the word ‘force’ here.* (ID “597hB5wiJ4S2”)

---

### 2. Section tDP2z2N5cRVB – Explore  
**Statement Box**  
Things can’t move by themselves.  
An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.

**Three parallel discussion panels and matching animations**

| Image / animation (alt text) | Student prompt | Answer example |
|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Children tugging a rope in a game | “Why is the rope moving?” | “The children are pulling it.” |
| A child riding a bike with an adult | “What is making the bike move?” | “The child is pushing the pedals and the woman is also pushing.” |
| A woman pushing a dog stroller | “What is making the pram move?” | “The woman is pushing it.” |

### 3. Section A7jzeoMVSrWP – Explore / Explain

**Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.

### 4. Section a19q3Vs5B1JS – Explore / Explain

Statement recap:  
When we push an object, it moves **away** from us.  
When we pull an object, it moves **towards** us.

Instruction: “Use the words to complete the sentences.”

Sentence 1 image – *A smiling girl pulls a silver suitcase.*  
Sentence frame:  
`I [____] the suitcase so it moves [____] me.`  
Correct answers: **pull / towards**

Sentence 2 image – *A girl pushes a shopping trolley.*  
Sentence frame:  
`I [____] the trolley so it moves [____] [____] me.`  
Correct answers: **push / away / from**

(All answer boxes supplied for students; colours match the word bank.)

#### 4 c. Sub-section KsXK5FwNWYRP – Brainstorm board  
Whiteboard image (alt: *Whiteboard displaying the text: “Example: Opening and closing a door.” with an eraser.*)  

Student instruction (kept verbatim):  
“As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.”

Statement:  
“To push or pull an object, we usually touch the object with our hands, another part of our body or with something like a stick or a bat.”

**Teaching Notes**  
*Students learn that to push or pull an object, we usually touch the object…* (ID “gcNXmYGKKWkG”)

### 5. Section aKhLQg1JE2FR – Explain  
Statement Box  
“We can use **arrows** to show the direction of a force.”

Instruction:  
“Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull?”  

There are six image–quiz pairs. Example shown:

| Image (alt text) | Multiple-choice question (always “Push or pull?”) | Correct answer |
