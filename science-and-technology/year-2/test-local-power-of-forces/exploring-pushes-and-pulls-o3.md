# Exploring Pushes and Pulls  
https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6280-exploring-pushes-and-pulls  

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* identify a force as a push or a pull.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Recognise that forces are pushes and pulls that make objects move.  
2. Explain that a push moves an object **away from** us and a pull moves an object **towards** us.  
3. Use arrows to show the direction of a force.  
4. Use the vocabulary *push, pull, towards, away from* in compound sentences.  
5. Conduct a simple investigation and represent data about pushes and pulls.

## Teacher Reading  
**Forces** – A force is any push or pull that can change an object’s motion or direction.  
**Pushes and pulls** – A push moves an object away; a pull brings it closer.  
**Direction of forces** – Forces have direction, often shown with arrows.  
**Objects and movement** – Objects stay still until a force makes them move, and keep moving in the same direction until another force acts.

## Note (Vocabulary)  
The bold words in the lesson are Tier 2 and 3 subject-specific terms. Teach them in context while building content knowledge.

## Introduction  
Show the cover image (Three children moving a wagon – one pulling, one pushing, one riding). Ask:

*Focus Question* – **“What makes things move?”**  

Prompt students to share everyday examples (toys, vehicles, doors). Record ideas to uncover prior knowledge and misconceptions.

## Section & Activity Breakdown  
(The order exactly follows the *Sections Overview* list. Sub-sections are indented.)

### 1. Engage – Video “Sledding Teamwork”  (section BmCVD3d3GiQY)

**Teaching Notes** (Engage)  
Students watch the sledding video and identify how the sled is moved (push and pull). They are **not** expected to use the word *force* yet.

**Sequence & Prompts**  
1. Instruction Box – “Watch the video *Sledding Teamwork* and then answer the questions.”  
2. Video stimulus.  
3. Discussion 1 – “How did they get the sled to move?”  
4. Discussion 2 – “Why is it called *Sledding Teamwork*?”

**Model Answers**  
• They pushed from behind and pulled with a rope at the front.  
• It took more than one person working together to make the sled move.

### 2. Explore – Why can’t things move by themselves?  (section tDP2z2N5cRVB)

**Teaching Notes** (Explore)  
Objects cannot move on their own; something must push or pull them. Students watch three short animations.

**Sequence & Prompts**  
1. Statement – “Things can’t move by themselves. An object that is still will stay still unless it is made to move.”  
2. Three side-by-side animated images + discussion boxes:  
   * “Why is the **rope** moving?” _(children tug-of-war)_  
   * “What is making the **bike** move?” _(child riding)_  
   * “What is making the **pram** move?” _(dog pram)_  

**Model Answers**  
• The children are pulling the rope.  
• The child pedals (pushes) and the adult also pushes the bike.  
• The woman is pushing the pram, so the dog moves.

### 3. Explain – Pushes & Pulls are Forces  (section A7jzeoMVSrWP)

**Teaching Notes** (Explore / Explain)  
Introduce the word *force*. All forces are pushes or pulls.

**Sequence**  
1. Statement – “**Pushes** and **pulls** are called **forces**. Forces make objects move.”  
2. Interactive sorting activity – decide if each example is a push or pull.  
3. Instruction – “Decide if each force is a push or a pull.”

_No fixed answers – students classify interactively and explain their reasoning._

### 4. Student Activity – Sentence Work & Word Bank  (section a19q3Vs5B1JS)

**Teaching Notes** (Explore / Explain)  
Push = away; Pull = towards. Students complete sentences using a word bank.

#### 4a. Main Activity (section a19q3Vs5B1JS)  
*Instruction* – “Use the words to complete the sentences.”

Sentence 1 prompt with image (girl pulling suitcase):  
“I ___ the suitcase so it moves ___ me.”

Sentence 2 prompt with image (girl pushing trolley):  
“I ___ the trolley so it moves ___ ___ me.”

**Answers**  
1. pull / towards  
2. push / away / from  

#### 4b. Sub-section – Forces Charades (xHUAwsspBJzv)

*Instruction* – “Play *Forces Charades* as a class or in pairs.”

Teaching Notes  
1. Select an activity from the brainstorm list.  
2. Act it out for a classmate to guess.  
3. Use the word bank (push, pull, towards, away from) to describe the force.

Example sentence card provided: “I pull the rope so it moves towards me.”

#### 4c. Sub-section – Brainstorm Slide (KsXK5FwNWYRP)

*Instruction* – “As a class, brainstorm activities that need a push, a pull or both to make something move.”  
Note: Includes reminder that we usually touch an object (hand, body, stick, bat) to push or pull it.

### 5. Student Activity – Arrows show Direction  (section aKhLQg1JE2FR)

**Teaching Notes** (Explain)  
Arrows help visualise force direction. Students look at each picture, decide if it shows a push or pull, and choose the correct option.

*Instruction* – “Look at each picture and the direction of the force. Is it a push or a pull? Push or pull?”

**Images & Answers**  
1. Worker with wheelbarrow (arrow away) – **Push**  
2. Figure helping another up (arrow towards) – **Pull**  
3. Person pulling box with rope (arrow towards) – **Pull**  
4. Hand pressing button (arrow away) – **Push**  
5. Person pushing large box (arrow away) – **Push**  
6. Hand pulling blind down (arrow towards) – **Pull**

---

### 6. Evaluate – Investigation Check-point  (section NUmu2Qr1v1vu)

**Teaching Notes** (Evaluate – checkpoint)  
Students conduct a mini-investigation: choose three objects, use a force to make each move and record the results.

Sequence  
1. Orange box – “Investigate how things move.”  
2. Instruction list (choose objects, use a force, draw arrows, label push/pull, complete sentence).  
3. Example (image of pushing a ball) + model sentence “I pushed the ball so it moved away from me.”

_Sub-section (sKMdmySUDHbZ) – Student template_  
• Word bank tiles (pushed, pulled, away from, towards).  
• 3 drawing boxes (Object 1-3).  
• Fill-in-the-blank sentence scaffold for each object.

_This slide is open-ended; collect as evidence of attainment._

### 7. Elaborate – Action Words Sort  (section t5RALcDDFWSd)

**Teaching Notes** (Elaborate)  
Students act out verbs then sort them into Push / Pull.

*Plain-text prompt* – “Many action words are used to describe forces.”  
Interactive categorise activity with tiles:

**Push** – shove, throw, press, close  
**Pull** – stretch, tug, tow, drag

_Sub-section (VoaTH7XRVcKD) – Action Word Cards_  
Students choose four verbs, complete a card for each:  
• record the action word  
• draw the action (arrow showing direction)  
• label it push or pull.

---

### 8. Elaborate – Non-living things that move objects  (section 2W50otiRE3Sz)

**Teaching Notes** (Elaborate)  
Students draw & label two non-living things that can push or pull objects.

*Statement* – “Objects can be pushed and pulled by living and non-living things.”

*Student prompt* –  
“Think of two examples of non-living things that can move objects by pushing or pulling. Draw and label them to show how they move something.”

_Image template: two blank squares side by side._

## Conclusion  

Revisit the focus question **“What makes things move?”**  
Have students share new understandings and correct any lingering misconceptions.
