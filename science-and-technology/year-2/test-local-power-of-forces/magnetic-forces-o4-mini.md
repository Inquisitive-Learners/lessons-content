---

## Learning Intention  
- Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

## Note  
Vocabulary Words  
>The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.  

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a **north pole** and a **south pole**. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.  

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.  

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Introduction  
_Show students the image:_  
> *A smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear.*  

**Ask the focus question:**  
> What force can push or pull an object without touching it?  

Encourage students to share any experiences or objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Document responses to gauge prior understanding and misconceptions.

## Section 2: Magnet Hunt  
**Time:** 10 minutes  

### Activity Description  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.

### Materials / Instruction Box  
> **Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.**

### Student Task  
**Complete the table:**

| Object | Material<br>(What is it made of?) | Prediction<br>(Will it attract?) | Observation<br>(Did it attract?) |
|:------:|:---------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|        |                                   |                                  |                                  |

### Section 2a: Analysis of Findings  
**Time:** 5 minutes  

Students now analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and think about what these materials have in common. They compare any unexpected outcomes and discuss whether those objects revealed something new about magnetism.

**Discussion Prompts:**  
- What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?  
- What did the magnets attract?  
- Were there any objects that surprised you?  
- Did anything unusual happen with any objects?

### Suggested Answers  
- Mostly **metal**, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.  
- Any objects containing metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
- (Students’ own observations.)

## Section 3: Poles and Magnetic Interaction  
**Time:** 10 minutes  

### Activity Description  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.

### Information (Statement Box)  
> The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**. They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**. Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.

### Task  
With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.

Image:  
> Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.

### Student Activities  
1. **Complete the sentences** (fill in the blanks):  
   - I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  
   - I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  

2. **Use the coloured boxes** labelled **north**, **south**, **repelled**, **attracted** to fill the blanks.  

3. **Draw and label** what happened in each case.

### Teaching Notes  
> Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.

### Suggested Answers  
- Opposite poles: **north** and **south** → **attracted**  
- Like poles: **north** and **north** (or **south** and **south**) → **repelled**

*(Students’ drawings to illustrate attraction and repulsion.)*

### Reflection  
> Students draw, label and complete sentences describing what happened when they put like and unlike poles together.

## Section 4: Maglev Train Experiment  
**Time:** 20 minutes  

### Activity Description  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how placement and polarity affect movement.

### Information (Statement Box)  
> A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.

Image:  
> A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.

### Challenge (Coloured Box)  
> **Challenge:** Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.

### Materials (Instruction Box)  
You will need:  
- A toy car  
- 2 magnets  
- Sticky tape  
- Road track  

Image:  
> Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.

### Student Task  
1. **Draw and label** a flow chart showing how you used the magnets to move the car.  
2. **Describe** how magnet placement and polarity affected the car’s movement.

### Teaching Notes  
> Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast and how their car moves.

### Suggested Answer  
> By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets can work together to move another object without touching them.

## Section 5: The Legend of Magnes and Magnetic Tricks  
**Time:** 20 minutes  

### Activity Description  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class.

### Information (Statement Box)  
> A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite. The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet. Many people thought that it had magic powers.

### Tasks  
1. **Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?**  
2. **Draw and label** your own magnet trick that seems magical.  
3. **Try the trick** on a classmate.

### Teaching Notes  
> Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class.

### Suggested Answer  
> A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.

*(Students’ own trick diagrams will vary.)*

## Section 6: Paper Plate & Paperclip Exploration  
**Time:** 20 minutes  

### Activity Description  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed.

### Demonstration (Speech Bubble)  
> I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.

Image:  
> A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.  
> Three speech bubbles each featuring a large white question mark.

### Discussion Questions  
1. **Do you think this is possible?**  
2. **Explain your thinking.**

### Teaching Notes  
> Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.

### Suggested Answers  
1. Yes.  
2. - If the magnet's force is strong enough, I think it will pull the paper clip without touching it because magnets can attract from a distance.  
   - A magnet's force can be strong enough to attract an object through another non-magnetic material.
