# Magnetic Forces

**Lesson URL:** https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6283-magnetic-forces

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image (a smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear) and ask the focus question. Encourage students to share any experiences or objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Document responses to gauge current understanding and identify misconceptions.

## Focus Question  
What force can push or pull an object without touching it?

## 1. Exploring Toys (Teacher)

**Activity 1** – Duration: 5 minutes  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.  
**High-Impact Teaching Strategies:** Questioning

1. Pose these questions (centered discussion boxes):  
   - What do they have in common?  
   - How do these toys work?

2. Show the image:  
   *A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set.*

**Suggested Answers:**  
- What do they have in common?  
  > They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.  
- How do these toys work?  
  - The magnetic fridge alphabet can be used to write messages on the fridge or to hold things in place on a fridge.  
  - The fishing game requires the player to use a pole with a magnet on its end to fish out the pieces.  
  - The magnetic tiles can be used to build new inventions.  
  - You can push and pull the toy train along a track or on a surface. A magnet connects the carriages to each other.

## 2. Classroom Object Hunt (Student)

**Activity 2** – Duration: 10 minutes  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.  
**High-Impact Teaching Strategies:** Questioning

1. **Instruction Box**  
   Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.

2. **Table** (Complete the table)  

   | Object | Material (What is it made of?) | Prediction (Will it attract to the magnet?) | Observation (Did it attract to the magnet?) |
   |--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
   |        |                                |                                             |                                               |
   |        |                                |                                             |                                               |
   |        |                                |                                             |                                               |
   |        |                                |                                             |                                               |

3. **Statement Box**  
   > The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it.

### 2.1 Analysing Results (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students now analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and think about what these materials have in common. They compare any unexpected outcomes and discuss whether those objects revealed something new about magnetism.

- **What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?**  
  > They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.

- **What did the magnets attract?**  
  > Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.

- **Were there any objects that surprised you?**  
  > I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.  
  > I was surprised my magnet attracted more than one object at a time.  
  > I was surprised my lunch box was not magnetic.  
  > I was surprised by how strong my magnet was.

- **Did anything unusual happen with any objects?**  
  > My magnet picked up several things at once.  
  > My magnet attracted an object from a distance.  
  > Certain parts of my magnet had a stronger force than other parts.

## 3. Exploring Magnetic Poles (Teacher)

**Activity 3** – Duration: 10 minutes  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.  
**High-Impact Teaching Strategies:** Collaboration, Multiple Exposures

1. **Statement Box**  
   > The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**.  
   > They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
   > Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.

2. **Instruction**  
   With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.

3. **Image**  
   *Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.*

### 3.1 Poles Activity (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw, label and complete sentences describing what happened when they put like and unlike poles together.

- **Sub-Activity: Complete the sentence.**  
  “I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.”  
  1. north / south / attracted  
  2. north / north / repelled  
  3. south / south / repelled

- **Sub-Activity: Draw and label what happened** for each scenario.

## 4. Maglev Train Model (Teacher)

**Activity 5** – Duration: 20 minutes (Differentiation 2)  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast and how their car moves.  
**High-Impact Teaching Strategies:** Differentiation

1. **Statement Box**  
   > A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.

2. **Image**  
   *A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.*

3. **Coloured Box (Challenge)**  
   **Challenge:** Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.

4. **Instruction Box (Materials)**  
   You will need:  
   - A toy car  
   - 2 magnets  
   - Sticky tape  
   - Road track

5. **Image**  
   *Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.*

### 4.1 Maglev Activity (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw and label a flow chart to explain how they moved the toy car using two magnets. Prompt them to note which poles were used and how this positioning helped the car move.

- **Sub-Activity: Draw, label and describe what you did** using a flow chart.
- **Sub-Activity: Text response**  
  “By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets …”  
  > “… can work together to move another object without touching them.”

## 5. The Legend of Magnes (Student)

**Activity 6** – Duration: 20 minutes (Differentiation 3)  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.  
**High-Impact Teaching Strategies:** Differentiation

1. **Statement Box**  
   > A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite.  
   > The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet.  
   > Many people thought that it had magic powers.

2. **Response**  
   **Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?**  
   > A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.

3. **Draw**  
   **Show how magnets can seem magical by creating your own magnet trick. Draw and label your trick below.**

4. **Coloured Box**  
   Try the trick on a classmate.

## 6. Sliding a Paper Clip (Teacher & Student)

**Activity 4** – Duration: 20 minutes (Checkpoint)  
**Teaching Notes (Discussion):**  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.

1. **Speech Bubble**  
   I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.

2. **Discussion Prompts:**  
   - Do you think this is possible?  
     > Yes.  
   - Explain your thinking.  
     > If the magnet's force is strong enough, I think the magnet will pull the paperclip without touching it because magnets can attract from a distance.  
     > A magnet's force can be strong enough to attract an object through another non-magnetic material.

3. **Images:**  
   - *A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.*  
   - *Three speech bubbles in pink and purple, each featuring a large white question mark.*

### 6.1 Paper Clip Sliding Challenge (Teacher)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students are given the challenge of making a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it. Assist them to collect materials and carry out their investigation. Encourage experimentation with different approaches, noticing how changes in movement alter the paper clip’s direction. Guide them to try using different parts of the magnet to see if the force is stronger in different places.

- **Coloured Box (Challenge):**  
  Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.

- **Instruction Box (Materials):**  
  - A magnet  
  - A metal paper clip  
  - A paper plate

- **Image:**  
  *A red and grey magnet, a paperclip, and a white plate on a light blue background.*

### 6.2 Flow Chart Reflection (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students complete a flow chart to describe how they made the paper clip move on the plate without direct contact. They present their drawings and share discoveries to confirm understanding of non-contact magnetic forces.

- **Sub-Activity: Draw, label and describe what you did** using a flow chart (First → Then → Next → Finally).
- **Sub-Activity: Text response**  
  “By doing this challenge, I discovered that a magnet …”  
  > “… can move metal objects through thin materials like paper or plastic without touching them.”
