https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6283-magnetic-forces  

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.  

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.  

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.  

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Activity 2: Object Hunt and Table of Results  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.”

### Part A: Object Hunt  
- **Instruction:**  
  > Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.  

- **Table:**  
  | Object | Material (What is it made of?) | Prediction (Will it attract to the magnet?) | Observation (Did it attract to the magnet?) |
  |───|───|───|───|
  |   |   |   |   |
  |   |   |   |   |
  |   |   |   |   |
  |   |   |   |   |

- After completing the table, display and discuss the statement:  
  > **The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it.**

### Part B: Analyse Your Findings  
**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students now analyse which materials were attracted to the magnet and think about what these materials have in common. They compare any unexpected outcomes and discuss whether those objects revealed something new about magnetism.”

- Pose these discussion prompts (collect text, drawings or uploads):  
  1. **What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?**  
     - *Suggested answer:* They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal lids.  
  2. **What did the magnets attract?**  
     - *Suggested answer:* Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
  3. **Were there any objects that surprised you?**  
     - *Suggested answer examples:*  
       - I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.  
       - I was surprised my magnet attracted more than one object at a time.  
  4. **Did anything unusual happen with any objects?**  
     - *Suggested answer examples:*  
       - My magnet could attract more than one object at a time.  
       - Certain parts of my magnet had a stronger force than other parts.  

- **Discuss your object hunt with the class.**

## Activity 3: Exploring Magnetic Poles  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.”

### Part A: Teacher Demonstration  
1. Explain:  
   > **The ends of a magnet are called the _north pole_ and the _south pole_.**  
   > They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
   > Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.  
2. **With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.**  
3. Show this image:  
   ![Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.](https://inquisitive-assets-app2.imgix.net/au/JT7yr7UbX65YeeO2ilZ8tACmGPv1S8D7.png)

### Part B: Student Response  
**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students draw, label and complete sentences describing what happened when they put like and unlike poles together.”

- **Word bank:** north  south  attracted  repelled  

- **Fill in the blanks and draw:**  
  1. I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  
     - *Answer:* north and south → attracted  
     - **Draw and label what happened.**  
     *(Example illustration: opposite poles pulling together.)*  

  2. I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  
     - *Answer:* north and north → repelled  
     - **Draw and label what happened.**  
     *(Example illustration: like poles pushing apart.)*  

  3. I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  
     - *Answer:* south and south → repelled  
     - **Draw and label what happened.**  
     *(Example illustration: like poles pushing apart.)*

## Activity 4 (Checkpoint): Magnetic Force at a Distance  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

**Teaching Note (Discussion):**  
> “Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.”

### Part A: Class Discussion  
- Show the student claim:  
  > “I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”  
- **Do you think this is possible?**  
  - *Suggested answer:* Yes.  
- Display the example image:  
  ![A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.](https://inquisitive-assets-app2.imgix.net/au/8ctlvLQrvXoY7ijN6jIFUQjHCAacKZZS.png)  
- **Explain your thinking.**  
  - *Suggested answer examples:*  
    - If the magnet’s force is strong enough, it can pull the paperclip without touching it.  
    - A magnet’s force can attract an object through another non-magnetic material.

### Part B: Hands-On Challenge  
**Teaching Note (Investigation):**  
> “Students are given the challenge of making a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it. Assist them to collect the materials they need and then carry out their investigation. Encourage students to experiment with different approaches, noticing how changes in movement alter the paper clip’s direction. Guide them to also try using different parts of the magnet to see if the force of a magnet is stronger in different places.”

- **Challenge:** Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.  
- **Materials (per student):**  
  - A magnet  
  - A metal paper clip  
  - A paper plate

## Activity 5: Maglev Train Challenge  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast and how their car moves.”

### Part A: Introduction to Maglev  
> **A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.**  

![A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.](https://inquisitive-assets-app2.imgix.net/au/SAVrdyjPt9wZe5ixdPnN1BV9oPctNng6.jpg)

### Part B: Challenge Instructions  
- **Challenge:** Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.  
- **Materials:**  
  - A toy car  
  - 2 magnets  
  - Sticky tape  
  - Road track  

![Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.](https://inquisitive-assets-app2.imgix.net/au/E9YfgokfTauRctToOrXX8Et7hTZQI5NM.jpg)

### Student Recording for Activity 5  
**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students draw and label a flow chart to explain how they moved the toy car using two magnets. Prompt them to note which poles were used and how this positioning helped the car move.”

- **Draw, label and describe what you did:**  
  - Use a flow chart (First → Then → Next → Finally).  
- **By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets …**  
  - *Suggested completion:* “… can work together to move another object without touching them.”

## Activity 6: Magnetic “Magic” Trick  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

**Teaching Note:**  
> “Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.”

### Part A: The Legend of Magnes  
> “A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite. The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet. Many people thought that it had magic powers.”

### Part B: Design Your Trick  
- **Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?**  
  - *Suggested answer:* A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.  
- **Show how magnets can seem magical by creating your own magnet trick. Draw and label your trick below.**  
- **Try the trick on a classmate.**
