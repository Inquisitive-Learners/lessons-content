# Magnetic Forces  
Lesson: [Magnetic Forces](www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6283-magnetic-forces)

---

## Learning Intention  
- Students are learning to: Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

### Activity 1 (Teacher) – Exploring Toys (5 minutes)  
**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.

**Steps**  
1. Display the image of toys.  
   - **Image alt text:** A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set.  
2. Ask: **What do they have in common?**  
3. Ask: **How do these toys work?**

**Model Answers**  
- What do they have in common?  
  “They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.”

- How do these toys work?  
  - The magnetic fridge alphabet can be used to write messages on the fridge or to hold things in place on a fridge.  
  - The fishing game requires the player to use a pole with a magnet on its end to fish out the pieces.  
  - The magnetic tiles can be used to build new inventions.  
  - You can push and pull the toy train along a track or on a surface. A magnet connects the carriages to each other.

### Activity 2 (Student) – Magnet Object Hunt (10 minutes)  
**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.

**Steps**  
1. Instruction:  
   > Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.  
2. Complete the table:

| Object | Material<br>What is it made of? | Prediction<br>Will it attract to the magnet? | Observation<br>Did it attract to the magnet? |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|        |                                |                                             |                                              |
|        |                                |                                             |                                              |
|        |                                |                                             |                                              |
|        |                                |                                             |                                              |

3. Discuss:
   - **What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?**  
   - **What did the magnets attract?**  
   - **Were there any objects that surprised you?**  
   - **Did anything unusual happen with any objects?**

**Model Answers**  
- Materials: “They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.”  
- Attracted: “Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.”  
- Surprises (examples):  
  - I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.  
  - I was surprised my magnet attracted more than one object at a time.  
  - I was surprised my lunch box was not magnetic.  
  - I was surprised by how strong my magnet was.  
- Unusual (examples):  
  - My magnet picked up several things at once.  
  - My magnet attracted an object from a distance.  
  - Certain parts of my magnet had a stronger force than other parts.

### Activity 3 (Teacher) – Exploring Poles (10 minutes)  
**Teaching Notes**  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.

**Main Teaching Points**  
- The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**.  
- Opposite poles attract; like poles repel.

**Steps**  
1. Read the statement:  
   > The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**. They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**.  
   > Magnets can also attract or repel (push away) the poles of another magnet.  
2. With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.  
3. Show the image of two horseshoe magnets.  
   - **Image alt text:** Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other.

**Student Task**  
Draw, label and complete sentences describing what happened when they put like and unlike poles together:

- I put a ____ pole and ____ pole together and they ____.  
  1. North pole + South pole → attracted.  
  2. North pole + North pole → repelled.  
  3. South pole + South pole → repelled.

**Model Answers**  
1. north  | south  | attracted  
2. north  | north  | repelled  
3. south  | south  | repelled  

*(Students illustrate each pairing.)*

**Reflection**  
> By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets can work together to move another object without touching them.

### Activity 4 (Teacher) – Sliding a Paper Clip (20 minutes)  
**Checkpoint Activity**  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.

**Steps**  
1. Read the speech bubble:  
   > I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.  
2. Ask: **Do you think this is possible?**  
3. Show the image.  
   - **Image alt text:** A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby.  
4. Ask: **Explain your thinking.**  
5. Show the question-mark prompt.  
   - **Image alt text:** Three speech bubbles in pink and purple, each featuring a large white question mark.

### Activity 5 (Teacher) – Maglev Train Model (20 minutes)  
**Differentiation 2**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast and how their car moves.

**Steps**  
1. Read the statement:  
   > A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.  
2. Show the maglev image.  
   - **Image alt text:** A bright yellow maglev train glides above a concrete track against a clear blue sky.  
3. Challenge:  
   > Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.  
4. Materials:  
   - A toy car  
   - 2 magnets  
   - Sticky tape  
   - Road track  
5. Show materials image.  
   - **Image alt text:** Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car.

### Activity 6 (Student) – Magnet Tricks (20 minutes)  
**Differentiation 3**

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.

**Steps**  
1. Read the statement:  
   > A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite.  
   > The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet.  
   > Many people thought that it had magic powers.  
2. Respond:  
   > Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?  
3. Draw:  
   > Show how magnets can seem magical by creating your own magnet trick. Draw and label your trick below.  
4. Try it on a classmate.

**Model Answer**  
> A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.
