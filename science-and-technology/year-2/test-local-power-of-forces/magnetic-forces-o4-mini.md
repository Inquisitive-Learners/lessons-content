## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Identify how the force of magnetism affects objects.

*(from “intention”)*

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Test the effect of magnets on different materials.  
- Recognise that magnets have a north and a south pole that attract or repel the poles of another magnet.  
- Prove that a magnet doesn’t need to touch an object to repel or attract it.  
- Create a flow chart to describe how magnetism affects objects.

*(from “success-criteria”)*

## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

*(from “note”)*

---

## Introduction  
Show students the image (a smiling boy in a top hat waves a magic wand at a flying teddy bear) and ask the focus question, **“What force can push or pull an object without touching it?”** Encourage students to share any experiences or objects they know of that seem to move without being touched. Document the students' responses to help gauge their current understanding and identify any misconceptions.

## Activity 2 (Student) – Object Hunt  
**Duration:** 10 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.  
*(from section okRZPyVN7yy9)*

### 2A. Instruction Box  
Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.

---

### 2B. Complete the table  
Columns: Object | Material – What is it made of? | Prediction – Will it attract to the magnet? | Observation – Did it attract to the magnet?  
*(Students fill freely.)*

---

### 2C. Discussion  
1. **What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?**  
   - **Answer:** “They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.”  
   *(component 1zuUJSbUxKC4)*

2. **What did the magnets attract?**  
   - **Answer:** “Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.”  
   *(component CSkRSh93X00N)*

3. **Were there any objects that surprised you?**  
   - **Answer (examples):**  
     - I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.  
     - I was surprised my magnet attracted more than one object at a time.  
     - I was surprised my lunch box was not magnetic.  
     - I was surprised by how strong my magnet was.  
   *(component HisFCfX52B7z)*

## Activity 3 (Teacher) – Poles and Forces  
**Duration:** 10 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.  
*(from section V814N2svNRqM)*

### 3A. Key Concept (Statement Box)  
> **The ends of a magnet are called the north pole and the south pole. They can attract (pull together) objects made of metal.  
> Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.*

---

### 3B. Explore with a Classmate  
With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.

_Image – Two hands hold a red and blue horseshoe magnet, facing each other._

---

## Activity 3 (Student) – Poles and Outcomes  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw, label and complete sentences describing what happened when they put like and unlike poles together.  
*(from section tXv0jarCYgkE)*

### 3C. Fill in the Blanks  
Complete each sentence:  
> **I put a [ ] pole and [ ] pole together and they [ ]**.  

| Scenario | Answers |
|—|—|
| Opposite poles | north, south, attracted. |
| North + north | north, north, repelled. |
| South + south | south, south, repelled. |

*(components GeWRqxHK7adJ, KznLtBVevseF, PkXympfZ6wUJ)*

## Activity 4 (Teacher) – Magnetic Trick Hypothesis  
**Duration:** 20 min (Checkpoint)  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide them to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.  
*(from section 5jL5o62jDbWX)*

> *“I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”*  
*(speech bubble example)*

_Image – A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby._

---

### 4A. Discussion: “Do you think this is possible?”  
- **Answer:** “Yes.”  
*(component rciGbCi06u5Y)*

### 4B. Discussion: “Explain your thinking.”  
- **Answer (examples):**  
  - If the magnet's force is strong enough, I think the magnet will pull the paperclip without touching it because magnets can attract from a distance.  
  - A magnet's force can be strong enough to attract an object through another non-magnetic material.  
*(component dmbkx13P1GD0)*

## Activity 4 (Teacher) – Paper-Plate Challenge  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students are given the challenge of making a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it. Assist them to collect the materials they need and then carry out their investigation. Encourage students to experiment with different approaches, noticing how changes in movement alter the paper clip’s direction. Guide them to also try using different parts of the magnet to see if the force of a magnet is stronger in different places.  
*(from section m2MFrKkGR8AX)*

### 4C. Challenge (Coloured Box)  
**Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.**

### 4D. Materials (Instruction Box)  
- A magnet  
- A metal paper clip  
- A paper plate  

_Image – A red and grey magnet, a paperclip, and a white plate on a light blue background._

### 4E. Try It!  
*(Encourage experimentation.)*

## Activity 5 (Teacher) – Maglev Train  
**Duration:** 20 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast and how their car moves.  
*(from section 8MGq7GU72SLA)*

> **A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.**

---

### 5A. Challenge (Coloured Box)  
**Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.**

### 5B. Materials (Instruction Box)  
You will need:  
- A toy car  
- 2 magnets  
- Sticky tape  
- Road track  

_Image – Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car._

---

## Activity 5 (Student) – Maglev Process  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw and label a flow chart to explain how they moved the toy car using two magnets. Prompt them to note which poles were used and how this positioning helped the car move.  
*(from section Fm3Xj3nGJSXd)*

### 5C. Draw, Label and Describe What You Did  
Use a flow chart with **First**, **Then**, **Next**, **Finally**.  
*(component xHyZc1diXWgz)*

### 5D. Reflection  
> **By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets ...**  
- **Answer:** “… can work together to move another object without touching them.”

## Activity 6 (Student) – Magnet Legend & Magic Trick  
**Duration:** 20 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.  
*(from section U4ByHnVMxfoR)*

> **A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite. The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet. Many people thought that it had magic powers.**

---

### 6A. Discussion: “Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?”  
- **Answer:** “A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.”  
*(component SwC3AYGsnCc7)*
