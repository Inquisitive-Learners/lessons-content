## Teacher Reading  
**Magnetic materials**  
Magnets attract objects containing certain metals such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Materials like plastic, wood or paper do not react to a magnet’s pull.

**Poles**  
Each magnet has a north and a south pole. When the same poles are brought together they repel, whereas opposite poles attract.

**Non-contact force**  
Magnets can push or pull certain objects without touching them because of their invisible magnetic field. This can be shown by moving a metal paper clip around a surface from underneath with a magnet.

**Common uses**  
Magnets are found in toys, compasses and many everyday objects where they provide a force without direct contact. Recognising magnets in different contexts helps students understand how they support movement, lifting and holding objects in place.

## Activity 1: Exploring magnetic toys  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore a variety of toys, finding the commonality between them. Prompt students to notice similarities in how the toys function.

**Instructions:**  
1. Show students this image:  
   _A child's hand plays with colourful letters on a fridge, a fishing toy, magnetic tiles and a wooden train set._  
2. Ask:  
   - “What do they have in common?”  
   - “How do these toys work?”

**Expected Responses:**  
- They all have magnets inside them so they can stick to metal objects or to each other.  
- They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.  
- Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
- I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.

## Activity 2: Testing materials with magnets (Object hunt)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that a magnet can pull or attract an object so it sticks to it. They use a magnet to test objects in the classroom and record their findings in a table. Encourage students to find objects made of different materials and to predict which items will attract to the magnet.

**Instructions:**  
1. Use a magnet to go on an object hunt in your classroom.  
2. Complete the table:

| Object | Material<br>What is it made of? | Prediction<br>Will it attract to the magnet? | Observation<br>Did it attract to the magnet? |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|        |                                |                                              |                                             |
|        |                                |                                              |                                             |
|        |                                |                                              |                                             |
|        |                                |                                              |                                             |

3. Discuss as a class:  
   - What type of materials were the attracted objects made from?  
   - What did the magnets attract?  
   - Were there any objects that surprised you?  
   - Did anything unusual happen with any objects?  

**Key Concept:**  
The toys all use magnets. A magnet can pull or **attract** an object so it sticks to it.

**Example Answers:**  
- Materials: They were mostly made from metal, such as steel paperclips and metal clips.  
- Attracted: Our magnets attracted any objects that contained metal, like pins, paperclips or metal lids.  
- Surprises:  
  - I was surprised that parts of my desk and some coins were magnetic.  
  - I was surprised my magnet attracted more than one object at a time.  
  - I was surprised my lunch box was not magnetic.  
  - I was surprised by how strong my magnet was.  
- Unusual observations:  
  - My magnet picked up several things at once.  
  - My magnet attracted an object from a distance.  
  - Certain parts of my magnet had a stronger force than other parts.

## Activity 3: Exploring magnetic poles  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students discover that magnets attract metal objects and have two poles: a north pole and a south pole. They work in pairs, bringing like and unlike poles together to observe if they pull or push each other.

**Content:**  
> The ends of a magnet are called the **north pole** and the **south pole**. They can attract (pull together) objects made of **metal**. Magnets can also attract or **repel** (push away) the poles of another magnet.

**Instructions:**  
1. With a classmate, use two magnets to explore what happens when you place poles that are the same or different together.  
2. Complete these sentences (use the word bank: **north**, **south**, **attracted**, **repelled**):  
   - I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  
   - I put a ___ pole and ___ pole together and they ___.  
3. Draw and label what happened in each scenario.

**Expected Answers:**  
- Opposite poles: north + south → **attracted**  
- Like poles: north + north → **repelled**

## Activity 4: Magnetism without contact  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

**Teaching Notes:**  
- Discuss whether it is possible to use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it. Guide students to share their reasoning about how magnetic forces might work over a distance and the strength needed to move something without touching it.  
- Students are given the challenge of making a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it. Assist them to collect materials and carry out their investigation. Encourage experimentation with different approaches, noticing how changes in movement alter the paper clip’s direction, and trying different parts of the magnet.

**Instructions:**  
1. Display the speech bubble:  
   *“I can use a magnet to slide a paper clip around a plate without the magnet touching it.”*  
2. Show this image:  
   _A surprised child points up, with a paper plate, paperclip, and magnet nearby._  
3. Ask: “Do you think this is possible?”  
4. Have students explain their thinking.  
5. Challenge: Make a paper clip slide around on a paper plate without the magnet touching it.  
6. Draw, label and describe what you did using a flow chart with stages **First**, **Then**, **Next**, **Finally**.  
7. Complete the sentence:  
   > By doing this challenge, I discovered that a magnet …

**Example Responses:**  
- “Yes.”  
- “By doing this challenge, I discovered that a magnet can move metal objects through thin materials like paper or plastic without touching them.”

## Activity 5: Maglev and magnetic propulsion  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn how a maglev train moves by using magnets to lift and propel it. They recreate this concept by using two magnets to push a toy car along a track without touching it. Encourage them to think about how the way they place the magnets (positioning) and which ends face each other (polarity) change how fast the car moves.

**Content:**  
> A maglev is a special kind of train that uses two sets of magnets that work together to move it. One set of magnets pushes the train up off the tracks, and the other set pulls the train along very fast.

**Instructions:**  
1. Read the challenge: **Challenge** – Using two magnets, move a toy car along a track without touching it.  
2. Gather materials:  
   - A toy car  
   - 2 magnets  
   - Sticky tape  
   - Road track  
3. Set up as shown in the image:  
   _Two magnets, adhesive tape, a winding road graphic, and a yellow toy car._  
4. Try it!  
5. Draw and label a flow chart to explain how you moved the toy car using two magnets. Note which poles were used and how this positioning helped the car move.  
6. Complete the sentence:  
   > By doing this challenge, I discovered that magnets …

**Example Response:**  
- “By doing this challenge, I discovered that … can work together to move another object without touching them.”

## Activity 6: Magnetic magic  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn about the legend of Magnes and explore why people thought magnets were magical. They create their own magnet trick that appears to defy expectations, and then perform it for the class. Have them draw and label their trick, explaining how the magnetic force creates the ‘magic’.

**Content:**  
> A legend says that long ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes discovered magnets when the nails in his shoe stuck to a rock made of magnetite. The ancient Greeks did not know about this natural magnet. Many people thought that it had magic powers.

**Instructions:**  
1. Why do you think people thought magnets had magic powers?  
2. Draw and label your own magnet trick below.  
3. Try the trick on a classmate.

**Example Answer:**  
- “A magnetic force is invisible so people could not see what caused the magnet to pull things closer, so it seemed like magic.”
