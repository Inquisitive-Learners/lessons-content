# Lesson: How Do Toys Work?

**Focus Question:** How do toys work?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.  
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.  
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.  
- Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading  
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural Perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys that show a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Section 1: Kendama Video (Activity 1)  
**Duration:** 5 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

### Activity Content  
1. **Info Box:**  
   - A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy.  
   - It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.

2. **Prompt:**  
   - Click on the kendama to watch the video.

## Section 2: Push & Pull Demonstration (Activity 2)  
**Duration:** 5 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up into the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

### Activity Content  
- **When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up into the air.**  
- **When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.**

## Section 4: Exploring Push, Pull & Spin (Activity 4)  
**Duration:** 15 min  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull, or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

### 4.1 Draw Forces on Toys  
- **Statement Box:** Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.  
- *Think, Pair, Share*  
- **Task:** Draw below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull, or both make each toy move.  
  - _Suggested Student Drawings (Examples):_  
    - A toy car with an arrow pushing from behind.  
    - A pull-along animal with a string arrow toward the child’s hand.  
    - A yo-yo with one arrow up (pull) and one arrow down (push).  

- **Discussion:** What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?  
  - _Model Answer (examples):_  
    - **Push:** Toy cars, push-along walkers, bouncing balls, dominoes, scooters.  
    - **Pull:** Toy wagons, pull-along animals, yo-yos, pull-string spinning toys.  
    - **Push & Pull Toys:** Stretchy action figures, toy trains with carriages, snap-on construction sets, spring launchers, accordion toys.

### 4.2 Watch Another Spinning Top  
**Teaching Notes:**
