# Lesson: How Do Toys Work?

**Focus Question:** How do toys work?

---

## Learning Intention
Students are learning to understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

## Success Criteria
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.
- Identify how spinning tops from **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples** are made and how they move.
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.
- Draw and label a flow chart to describe the process of making and moving a spinning top.

## Teacher Reading
**Push and pull**  
Push and pull forces are vital for many toys because they set objects in motion or stop them from moving.

**Twisting**  
A twist combines both push and pull forces to rotate objects, like when you spin a top by twisting its stem. You apply force in two opposite directions at the same time, causing circular motion.

**Cultural Perspectives**  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a long history of creating spinning toys that show a deep understanding of motion and design. Their skill in making tops demonstrates their connection to Country and their knowledge of the forces that affect everyday objects.

## Note
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction
Show students the image (Alt: “A father and son using their hands to twist spinning toys.”). Ask the focus question, “How do toys work?” Encourage students to share personal experiences with toys they use. Document and use the students’ responses to gauge their current understanding and identify any misconceptions.

## Section 1: Exploring Push and Pull with Kendama  
**Activity 1 (5 minutes)**  
Which part is pushed?  
Which part is pulled?

**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch the kendama video and identify which parts of the toy are pushed and which are pulled. Encourage students to discuss how pushing and pulling create different motions, linking each action to how the kendama works. Have students share their findings by explaining what they noticed about how a push and pull power the toy.

**Procedure**  
1. Display statement:  
   > A **kendama** is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle.  
2. Prompt: “Click on the kendama to watch the video.”  
3. Play the video (stimulus ID 3741).  
4. Ask: “Which part is pushed?” (students respond in text, drawing or upload)  
5. Ask: “Which part is pulled?” (students respond in text, drawing or upload)  
6. Show image for discussion:  
   - Alt: “Cartoon boy thinking with a large question mark above his head.”

**Student Instructions (exact)**  
- Which part is pushed?  
- Which part is pulled?

**Model Answers**  
- Which part is pushed?  
  > The handle is pushed upward to lift the ball into the air.  
- Which part is pulled?  
  > We pull the handle toward us to help catch the ball on the spike or in the cup.

## Section 2: Understanding Push and Pull Actions  
**Activity 2 (5 minutes)**  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up into the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up into the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

**Procedure**  
1. Present two statement boxes side by side:  
   - **Left box:** “When we push the stick, it can help the ball go up into the air.”  
   - **Right box:** “When we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the cup or spike.”  
2. Show images:  
   - Alt: “A boy demonstrates how a Kendama ball is thrown up by pushing the stick up.” (caption: **Push**)  
   - Alt: “A boy demonstrates how to catch a Kendama by pulling the stick towards the falling ball.” (caption: **Pull**)  
3. Discuss and have students act out the push and pull movements.

## Section 3: Push and Pull Animations  
**Activity 3 (5 minutes)**  
Students explore Rive animations demonstrating push and pull.

**Teaching Notes**  
Students explore how pushing the stick sends the kendama ball up into the air and how pulling it helps catch the ball. Prompt students to connect these actions to the way the toy’s movement changes. It is suggested that the students act out using a kendama to physically feel the push and pull movement.

**Procedure**  
1. Show two Rive animations side by side:  
   - **Push variant** (labels: “Push stick”, “Ball goes up”)  
     - Alt: “Child with a push stick, focused on making a ball rise above his hand.”  
   - **Pull variant** (labels: “Pull stick”, “Catch ball”)  
     - Alt: “A child with a toy demonstrating the actions ‘Pull stick’ and ‘Catch ball’.”  
2. Enable text labels.  
3. Discuss how each animation illustrates push vs pull.

## Section 4: Think, Pair, Share – Push, Pull, or Both  
**Activity 4 (15 minutes)**  
Draw arrows to show how a push, a pull, or both make each toy move. Then discuss: What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that many toys require a push, a pull, or both to work. They participate in a *Think, Pair, Share* activity to identify other toys they know that use push or pull forces. Students then document their thinking by drawing and labelling their examples, using arrows to show the direction of the push and pull forces acting on each toy.

**Procedure**  
1. Display statement box:  
   > Many other toys need a push, a pull or both to work.  
2. **Think-Pair-Share** prompt:  
   > What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?  
3. Sub-Activity 1 (DRAW):  
   - Instruction (exact): “Draw them below, using arrows to show how a push, a pull, or both make each toy move.”  
4. Sub-Activity 2 (DISCUSSION):  
   - Instruction (exact): “What other toys do you know that need a push, a pull or both to work?” (text, draw or upload)

**Model Answers**  
- Examples students might draw:  
  - A small toy car with an arrow forward (push)  
  - A toy animal on wheels with a string and arrow toward the hand (pull)  
  - A yo-yo with arrows down (push) and up (pull)  
- Push toys: Toy cars, push-along walkers, bouncing balls, dominoes, scooters.  
- Pull toys: Toy wagons, pull-along animals, yo-yos, spinning pull-string toys.  
- Push & Pull toys: Stretchy action figures, toy trains with detachable carriages, construction sets with snap-on parts, spring-loaded launchers, accordion-style musical toys.

### Subsection 4.1: Watching Another Spinning Top  
**Teaching Notes**  
Students watch a video of another type of spinning top to observe how it moves. Guide them to identify which forces start the spinning movement and keep it going. Students share their thoughts around how a force is key to a spinning top's function.

**Procedure**  
1. Instruction box (exact): “Watch the video to see another type of spinning top. Talk about the questions.”  
2. Play video (stimulus ID 19250).  
3. Ask (exact): “Why is the spinning top moving?”  
4. Ask (exact): “How is it moving?”  
5. Responses: text, draw, upload.

**Model Answers**  
- Why is the spinning top moving?  
  > It's moving because someone gave it a quick twist, adding enough force to spin it around.  
- How is it moving?  
  > It is spinning around in a circle on its tip until it slows down and stops. It is also propelling forward slowly with the spinning force.

### Subsection 4.2: Cultural Perspectives on Spinning Tops  
**Teaching Notes**  
Explain to students that many cultures make toys that use pushes and pulls. For example, the First Nations Peoples of Australia and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have a rich history of using spinning tops as both children's toys and as part of a sporting game played by young men. Have students explore the Australian Museum’s website to view what the First Nations Australians' spinning top toys looked like. Ask them to choose one of the spinning tops and talk about how it was made, then draw what it looks like.

## Section 9: Totem Tennis – Applying Push and Pull  
**Activity 9 (20 minutes)**  
Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing totem tennis. Describe how you can make the ball go faster.

**Teaching Notes**  
This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’ attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis. Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster.

**Procedure**  
1. Display info-box:  
   > Totem tennis is a game where you hit a ball. The ball is attached to a pole with a rope.  
2. Show image: Alt: “Boy hitting a ball on the totem tennis structure with a paddle.”  
3. Exact instruction:  
   > Draw and label a diagram using arrows to show the direction of forces you think are in action when playing totem tennis.  
4. Exact instruction:  
   > Describe how you can make the ball go faster.

**Model Answers**  
- **Diagram:** Arrow showing the push from the paddle, arrow showing the pull of the rope around the pole.  
- **Making it go faster:** You can hit the ball harder with the paddle or shorten the rope so the ball travels faster around the pole.
