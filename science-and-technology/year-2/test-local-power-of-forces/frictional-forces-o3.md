# Lesson: Frictional Forces  
URL: <https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6282-frictional-forces>

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
2. Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on an object’s motion.  
3. Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
4. Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
5. Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
6. Use compound sentences to describe friction.  

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises because of the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.  
**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections. Rougher surfaces have larger bumps, which lead to greater friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.  

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words. They appear in **bold** within the lesson.  

## Introduction (Engage)  
Show students the landscape image (alt text: *“A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy sitting inside on a carpeted floor.”*) and ask the focus question:

> **What slows an object down?**

Invite students to share times they have noticed something slow down or stop (e.g., a rolling ball on grass). Record their ideas to uncover prior knowledge and misconceptions.

## 1 . Investigation: Which Block Slides First?  
(Teacher page – Section **QziCYWLNH5Dr**, subsections follow in order)

### 1a. Predict & Discuss  
Sub-section **QziCYWLNH5Dr**  
*Teaching Notes (from 5zsH9cnhC5dr)*  
Introduce the ramp with three surfaces (rough sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap). Ask:

* “Which block do you think will slide down the ramp first? Why?”  
* Encourage words such as *bumpy, lumpy, rough, smooth*.

Present the interactive animation (alt text: *“Hand holding a layered board labelled with bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper.”*).

**Think, Pair, Share** – students record their prediction in the discussion box.

**Answer example**  
“It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has fewer bumps.”

---

### 1b. Materials  
Sub-section **D5yjZPvU2kn5**  
*Plain text box:* “With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.”

**Instruction Box – Materials**  
Each pair will need:  
• A ramp (cardboard) with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
• Three identical small block-shaped objects  

Image (alt text: *“Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.”*)

*Teaching Notes (afSGX00mSoDR)* – list of suggested covering materials is provided.

**Guiding Question (Coloured Box)**  
“Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?”

---

### 1c. Steps & Predictions  
Sub-section **HwGQYsChJw0u**  

**Steps (Instruction Box)**  
1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, lining them up.  

**Predict (Coloured Box)** – Students answer two response prompts:

* On which surface will a block slide first? Why?  
  *Example answer:* “Foil – it is smooth so friction is weak.”  
* On which surface will a block slide last? Why?  
  *Example answer:* “Sandpaper – it is rough so friction is strong.”  

Interactive animation shows an example ramp (alt text: *“Three textured materials on a wooden surface: bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper.”*).

---

### 1d. Observe  
Sub-section **3qErgzDZrkLm**  

**Step 3 (Instruction Box)**  
“Slowly and steadily tilt the ramp until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.”

Students:  
* Draw and label what happened (Draw tool).  
* “Observe” Coloured Box reminds them of the skill.

Interactive animation (alt text: *“A hand holds up a ramp with three different material surfaces, text says ‘Lift the ramp’.”*).

---

### 1e. Explain Results  
Sub-section **iY35BNTaNrNW**  

Coloured Box heading: **Explain**

Students answer:  
1. Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt?  
   *Example answer:* “Foil surface needed the lowest lift.”  
2. Which surface needed the greatest tilt?  
   *Example answer:* “Sandpaper needed the highest lift.”  
3. Why do you think that is?  
   *Example answers provided:*  
   * “It is smoother so the block began moving quickly.”  
   * “Sandpaper is the roughest material and slowed the block down.”

---

## 2 . Reading & Vocabulary: “Friction”  
(Teacher page – Section **754uXFtDskJZ**, sub-section **BRJxXCQiWhWX**)

### Teaching Notes (P9MJ6iEc2TcK & 3HngCrJvkt0T)  
Read the eBook aloud (*Info-box: “Read the eBook to learn more.”*). Pause to ask:  
* “Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?”  
* “When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?”

### Activity  
1. **Statement Box** – *“Friction is the force that slows down moving things …”*  
2. Students complete two **Fill-in-the-Blank** sentences using the word bank tiles.

| Sentence | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| Sandpaper has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction. | **rough**, **strong** |
| Ice has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction. | **smooth**, **weak** |

3. **Write your own sentence** – Response box.  
   Example: “Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.”

### Assessment note (bGrb5EfmGSU8)  
Use students’ sentences for an informal check of their ability to describe friction strength.

## 3 . Direction of Friction Forces  
(Teacher page – Section **UYQVs5naAF8K**, sub-section **G4biyyVUT93Q**)

### Teaching Notes (iywcdbhxLfPv & owhiVoMwTrtV)  
Emphasise that friction always acts in the **opposite** direction to movement and is usually weaker than the push force.

### Activity Flow  
1. **Statement Box** – definition of opposing direction.  
2. **Coloured Box** – “We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.”  
3. Interactive animation (child in a box, alt text: *“A child joyfully sits in a cardboard box …”*).  
   Students discuss:  
   * “Why is the friction arrow shorter?”  
   * “In which direction is friction working?”  
   * “In which direction is the box being pushed?”

   Example answers:  
   * Friction is weaker, so the arrow is shorter.  
   * Friction acts opposite to the push.  
   * The box is being pushed forward.

4. **Draw task** – Four-panel cartoon (alt text: *“Four panels: a boy sliding, a woman shopping, a girl on a scooter, and a boy raking leaves.”*)  
   Instructions:  
   * Draw one arrow for movement, one for friction.  
   * Label the arrows “movement” and “friction”.

   Example image answer is provided to students.

## 4 . Shoes & Surfaces  
(Student page – Section **Hnj3ST7v1QZ9**, sub-section **iaKAeYV2qReD**)

### Teaching Note (XVsZJZAyALrr & syZzGnju5E3c)  
Students explore how footwear is designed for different surfaces and amounts of friction.

### Activity  
Image of four shoes (alt text: *“Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.”*).

| Shoes | Activity | Surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Climbing or hiking | Ice or snow |
| B | Ballet dancing | Smooth wooden stage floors |
| C | Football games | Grass |
| D | Rollerskating | Smooth paths / skating rinks |

**Explain prompts**  
* Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
  *Example:* “A – crampons have spikes that grip ice.”  
* Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  
  *Example:* “D – rollerblades have wheels that reduce friction.”  

**Draw** – Students think of a special shoe and draw it.

## 5 . Design a Special Shoe  
(Student page – Section **n0uN9MH9vm7B**)

### Teaching Note (hgphDZZNPKwS)  
Students design footwear suited to a particular activity, thinking about how much friction is needed.

### Activity  
1. Statement Box – information about ice skates (alt text: *“Ice skates are designed …”*).  
2. Coloured Tip: *“Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.”*  
3. **Draw & Label** – “Design a new shoe for a special place or activity.”  
   (Image of snowshoes, alt text: *“A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground …”* for inspiration.)

Students label how each part of the shoe helps the wearer.
