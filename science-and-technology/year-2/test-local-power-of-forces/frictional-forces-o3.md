# Lesson: Frictional Forces  
https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6282-frictional-forces  

---

## Lesson Overview  

### Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

### Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
2. Conduct an investigation and record observations of how friction affects motion.  
3. Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
4. Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
5. Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of movement and friction forces.  
6. Use compound sentences to describe friction.

### Focus Question  
*What slows an object down?*

### Teacher Reading (Background Knowledge)  
**Friction as a force** – Friction opposes motion when two surfaces meet. The microscopic bumps and grooves on rougher surfaces cause greater friction than smoother surfaces.  

### Note (Vocabulary)  
Tier 2 & 3 vocabulary words appear in **bold** throughout the lesson. Explicitly teach these words in context.

### Introduction (Engage)  
Display the landscape image (A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy on carpet) and pose the focus question.  
Prompt students to share times they have seen an object slow down and what caused it.

### 1. Investigation Set-up – Section **QziCYWLNH5Dr** (Teacher Page)  
20 min  

| Sub-section | Purpose | Key Teaching Points | Teaching Notes | Answers / Model Responses |
|-------------|---------|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Think, Pair, Share** (components *huLjdyKtdrXk*, *q9zQoVWf6H9p*, *mArPBeyuvARm*) | Predict which block will slide first on a ramp with 3 surfaces (rough sand-paper, aluminium foil, bubble-wrap). | • Use descriptive words: *rough, smooth, bumpy*. <br>• Friction works against motion. | Ask: “Which block do you think will slide first and why?” Encourage drawings or written ideas. | • Likely answer: *“The block on the foil will slide first because foil is smoother.”* |
| **D5yjZPvU2kn5 – Materials & Question** | Provide equipment list & investigation question. | Materials box shows: cardboard ramp with 3 surfaces, 3 identical blocks. | “With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.” | – |
| **HwGQYsChJw0u – Predict** | Step-by-step instructions & prediction prompts. | 1. Make the ramp. <br>2. Line blocks up. | Students record: • *On which surface will a block slide first? Why?*  <br>• *…slide last? Why?* | • First: *foil* (smooth, weak friction). <br>• Last: *sandpaper* (rough, strong friction). |
| **3qErgzDZrkLm – Observe** | Carry out test; draw what happened. | Slowly tilt ramp until all blocks slide. Students draw & label observations. | Suggest repeating twice for reliability. | Varies – look for order: foil first, bubble-wrap second, sand-paper last. |
| **iY35BNTaNrNW – Explain** | Analyse results. | Students answer: <br>• “Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt…?” <br>• “Which…needed the greatest tilt…? Why?” | Prompting questions: “Why was a small lift enough on one surface but not another?” | • Smallest tilt: *foil* <br>• Greatest tilt: *sandpaper* <br>• Reason: smoother surfaces create weaker friction; rough surfaces stronger. |

**Images / Media**  
*Rive animation* – Hand holding layered board (bubble-wrap, foil, sand-paper).  
*Image* – Various crafting materials (blocks, felt, carpet etc.).  
*Image* – “Lift the ramp” animation. Alt text provided for all.

### 2. Reading & Checkpoint – Section **754uXFtDskJZ** (Teacher Page)  
10 min – Checkpoint  

| Sub-section | Purpose | Activity |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Statement Box** – “Friction is the force that slows…” | Introduce definition. |
| **Plain Text** – “Read the eBook to learn more.” | Students explore interactive eBook on friction (image of an open digital book). |
| **BRJxXCQiWhWX** (Student Page – Checkpoint) | Word-bank & Fill-in-the-Blanks sentences. <br>Sentence 1: “Sandpaper has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.” <br>Sentence 2: “Ice has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.” | **Word Bank**: *rough • bumpy • smooth • weak • strong*<br><br>**Answers** 1. rough / strong <br>2. smooth / weak <br><br>Students then write their own sentence about another surface. Example: “Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.” |

Teaching Notes (P9MJ6iEc2Tc, 3HngCrJvkt0T, bGrb5EfmGSU8)  
• Make informal assessment of vocabulary & concept understanding.  
• Link eBook to earlier investigation: “Did friction occur on your ramp?”

### 3. Forces & Arrows – Section **UYQVs5naAF8K** (Teacher Page)  
10 min – Checkpoint  

| Sub-section | Purpose | Key Points | Answers |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Statement Box** – “Friction always works in the **opposite** direction…” | Consolidate idea that friction opposes motion. | Show arrow diagrams. |
| **Coloured Box** – “We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.” | Visual scaffold. |
| **Student Discussion (y6PT7AWGCFvo, JGhWPSomnYzg, 1sVBtpB45mrc)** | Small-group response to 3 questions. | 1. Why is friction arrow shorter? (It is weaker than push) <br>2. Direction of friction? (Opposite to push) <br>3. Direction the box is pushed? (Forward/right) |
| **G4biyyVUT93Q** (Student Draw task) | Pupils draw two arrows on each of four cartoons (boy sliding, woman shopping trolley, girl scooter, boy raking). | Arrows: long arrow = movement; shorter opposite arrow = friction. | Model image provided in teacher answers file. |

Teaching Notes (iywcdbhxLfPv, owhiVoMwTrtV, Tm3ov024ubVr)  
• Emphasise arrow length = strength.  
• Check students place arrows in opposite directions.

### 4. Shoe Surfaces – Section **Hnj3ST7v1QZ9** (Student Page)  
10 min  

| Activity | Steps |
|----------|-------|
| **Image & Table (KbRWL5M3hF9b)** – Four shoes: A) crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades. Students complete table: Activity & Surface for each shoe. | Example Answers: <br>A. climbing / ice or snow <br>B. ballet dancing / smooth wooden stage <br>C. football games / grass <br>D. rollerskating / smooth paths |
| **iaKAeYV2qReD – Reasoning** | Q1. Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know? <br>Q2. Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know? <br>Q3. Draw shoes you wear for a special surface. | Model answers: <br>• Most: A – crampons (spikes dig in). <br>• Least: D – rollerblades (wheels reduce friction). |

Teaching Note (XVsZJZAyALrr, syZzGnju5E3c)  
• Students elaborate by justifying friction differences.

### Appendix – Word Bank & Sentence Answers  

1. Sandpaper has a **rough** surface so it makes **strong** friction.  
2. Ice has a **smooth** surface so it makes **weak** friction.

> **Teacher tip:** Throughout the lesson, continually link students’ practical findings back to the formal statements about friction (e.g., *“Friction always works in the opposite direction to movement”*). Encourage precise language: *smooth / rough*, *weak / strong*, *opposite force*.
