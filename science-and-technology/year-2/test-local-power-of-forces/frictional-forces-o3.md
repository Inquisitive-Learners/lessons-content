URL: <https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6282-frictional-forces>

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
* Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
1. Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
2. Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
3. Describe surfaces as *smooth* or *rough*.  
4. Explain that **friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces**.  
5. Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
6. Use compound sentences to describe friction.  

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.  

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.  

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image (alt text: *A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy sitting inside on a carpeted floor.*) and ask the focus question, *“What slows an object down?”*  
Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping (e.g. a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track) and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding and to identify any misconceptions.

## Focus Question  
**What slows an object down?**

# Activity Sequence  
(Sections and subsections appear in the exact order given in the Sections Overview.)

---

## 1. Investigate: “Which block will slide first?”  
**Section:** QziCYWLNH5Dr (Teacher page)  
### a. Think, Pair, Share (sub-section D5yjZPvU2kn5)  
*Display the layered ramp (alt text: *Hand holding a layered board labelled with bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper.*).*

Teaching notes (teacher sequence IDs: 5zsH9cnhC5dr & PwNVoCqM5AfG):  
* Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types.  
* Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and *why*.  
* Encourage the use of words such as *bumpy, lumpy, rough* and *smooth*.  
* Materials needed (per pair):  
  - A ramp (cardboard) divided into three equal-sized surfaces of different materials (e.g. rough sandpaper, aluminium foil, bubble wrap)  
  - Three identical small block-shaped objects  

Plain-text prompt shown to students:  
> Look at the three different surfaces on this ramp.  

Coloured box prompt: *Think, Pair, Share.*

### b. Investigation Set-Up (sub-section D5yjZPvU2kn5 – “Materials”)  
Instruction box (Materials):  
* “Materials  
  Each pair will need:  
  • A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
  • Three identical small block-shaped objects”

Image alt text: *Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.*

Coloured box (question): *Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?*

### c. Predict (sub-section HwGQYsChJw0u)  
Instruction boxes – **Steps**  
1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, making sure they are lined up.

Coloured box: **Predict**

Student responses (text fields):  
* “On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?”  
* “On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?”

Suggested answers  
* First: *It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has less bumps.*  
* Last: *It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy.*

### d. Observe (sub-section 3qErgzDZrkLm)  
Instruction box – **Step 3**  
* “Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.”

Coloured box: **Observe**  

Students complete a drawing: “Draw and label what happened.”  
Rive animation label: *Lift the ramp* (alt text: *A hand holds up a ramp with three different material surfaces.*)

### e. Explain (sub-section iY35BNTaNrNW)  
Coloured box: **Explain**

Instruction box – **Step 4**  
* “Record your results.”

Student response prompts:  
1. “Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?”  
2. “Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?”  
3. “Why do you think that is?” (two separate text fields – one for the easiest surface, one for the hardest)

Suggested answers  
* Smallest tilt: *The foil surface needed the lowest lift.*  
* Greatest tilt: *Sandpaper needed the highest lift.*  
* Why (foil): *It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.*  
* Why (sandpaper): *It is the roughest material and slows the block down.*

## 2. Read & Write about Friction  
**Section:** 754uXFtDskJZ (Teacher page)  
### Sub-section BRJxXCQiWhWX  
Statement box: **Friction** *is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.*  

Info-box: *Read the eBook to learn more.* (Embedded e-book appears.)

Teaching notes (P9MJ6iEc2TcK, 3HngCrJvkt0T, bGrb5EfmGSU8):  
* Read the eBook with the class and ask:  
  - “Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?”  
  - “When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?”  
* Students complete sentences using the word bank and then write their own sentence.  
* Informal assessment opportunity: listen for correct use of *rough/smooth, strong/weak friction*.

Student task – Fill-in-the-blanks (word bank in coloured boxes: **rough, bumpy, smooth, weak, strong**)  
Sentences:  
1. “Sandpaper has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.”  
   *Answers: rough, strong*  
2. “Ice has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.”  
   *Answers: smooth, weak*  

Open response: “Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.”  
Suggested sample: *Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.*

## 3. Explain: “Friction works in the opposite direction”  
**Section:** UYQVs5naAF8K (Teacher page)  
### a. Key idea  
Statement box:  
* “Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.”  

Info-box:  
* “We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.”

### b. Discuss with animations  
Rive animation (alt text: *A child joyfully sits in a cardboard box, pushed by an adult, illustrating friction and movement.*) shows two arrows (*Movement*, *Friction*).

Discussion-response prompts (students answer in any format):  
* “Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?”  
* “In which direction is friction working in?”  
* “In which direction is the box being pushed?”

Suggested answers  
* The friction arrow is smaller because friction is weaker than the push force.  
* Friction works in the opposite direction to the push.  
* The box is being pushed forward, in the same direction as the longer movement arrow.

### c. Draw the forces (sub-section G4biyyVUT93Q)  
Image alt text: *Four panels: a boy sliding, a woman shopping, a girl on a scooter, and a boy raking leaves.*

Student instructions:  
* Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
* Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
* Label your arrows as “movement” and “friction”.

Teaching note (iywcdbhxLfPv, owhiVoMwTrtV, Tm3ov024ubVr):  
* Reinforce that arrows should point in opposite directions and the longer arrow represents the stronger force.

## 4. Elaborate: Shoe Surfaces and Friction  
**Section:** Hnj3ST7v1QZ9 (Student page)  
### Sub-section iaKAeYV2qReD  
Statement box:  
* “When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work... The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.”

Image alt text (both subsections share the same description): *Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.*

Student table to complete:  
| Shoes | For what type of activity are the shoes designed? | For what type of surface are the shoes designed? |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| A | climbing or hiking | ice or snow |
| B | ballet dancing | smooth wooden stage floors |
| C | football games | grass |
| D | rollerskating | smooth paths or skating rinks |

Follow-up responses:  
1. “Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?”  
   *Answer: Shoes A (crampons) – the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.*  
2. “Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?”  
   *Answer: Shoes D (rollerblades) – wheels reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.*  

Drawing task: “Think of a time when you have or might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.”

Teaching note (XVsZJZAyALrr, syZzGnju5E3c):  
* Students explore different shoes, identify surfaces and decide which provide the most / least friction, justifying their answers.

## 5. Elaborate: Design a New Shoe  
**Section:** n0uN9MH9vm7B (Student page)  

Instruction (draw box):  
* “Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.”  

Info-box: *“Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.”*  
Image alt text: *A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground, with footprints nearby.*  
Statement box: *“Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop.”*

Teaching note (hgphDZZNPKwS):  
* Students design a shoe, label each feature, and present to show understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.
