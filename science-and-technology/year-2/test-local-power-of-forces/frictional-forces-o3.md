# Lesson: Frictional Forces  
https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6282-frictional-forces  

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
• Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
• Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
• Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
• Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
• Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
• Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
• Use compound sentences to describe friction.  

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.  

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

## Note – Vocabulary Words  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image (alt text: *A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy sitting inside on a carpeted floor.*) and ask the focus question, *“What slows an object down?”* Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Focus Question  
**What slows an object down?**

## 1. Investigation: Which block will slide first?  (Teacher page – Section QziCYWLNH5Dr)

| Approx. time | 20 min |
|--------------|--------|

### Teaching Notes  
Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why. It may be beneficial to have sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap available for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect each block's movement. Encourage the use of words such as *bumpy, lumpy, rough* and *smooth*.

### Activity Components  
1. **Text prompt** – “Look at the three different surfaces on this ramp.”  
2. **Think, Pair, Share** box.  
3. **Discussion response (Think, Pair, Share)**  
   *Prompt:* “Which block do you think will slide down the ramp first?  
   Explain your thinking.”  
   *Suggested answer:* “The block on the foil will slide first because foil is smoother than the other surfaces.”  
4. **Rive animation** – (*alt text:* *Hand holding a layered board labelled with bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper.*)

### 1a. Sub-section F – Plan & Gather Materials (Section D5yjZPvU2kn5)

#### Teaching Notes  
Explain to students they will be working in pairs to investigate how different surfaces affect how an object slides. Read through the materials list together and assist students to collect what they need.  
Possible materials for covering the ramp are: rough sandpaper, aluminium foil, bubble wrap, felt, carpet, astro turf, velcro, plastic wrap.

#### Activity Components  
• Plain text: “With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.”  
• Instruction box **Materials** – “Each pair will need:  
  – A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
  – Three identical small block-shaped objects”  
• Image (*alt text:* *Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.*)  
• Question box – “Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?”

---

### 1b. Sub-section m – Plan & Predict (Section HwGQYsChJw0u)

#### Teaching Notes  
Students follow the steps of the investigation by first setting up a ramp using three different materials, and placing a block on each surface. Discuss how to make sure all three blocks start from a fair place on the ramp. Once the students have created their ramps, they make predictions about which surface will let the block slide first and which will slow it down the most. Ask students to record and explain their thinking.

#### Activity Components  
• Instruction box **Steps**  
  1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
  2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, making sure they are lined up.  
• Predict box.  
• Response prompts:  
  – “On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?”  
    Sample answer: “Foil – it is smoother so there is less friction.”  
  – “On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?”  
    Sample answer: “Sandpaper – it is rougher so it slows the block down.”  
• Rive animation example of three materials (*alt text:* *Three textured materials on a wooden surface: bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper.*)

---

### 1c. Sub-section n – Observe (Section 3qErgzDZrkLm)

#### Teaching Notes  
Once students have made their predictions, they begin their investigation. They gradually lift the ramp, paying close attention to when each block begins to slide. Students draw and label their observations. They may want to draw three versions of the ramp to show the inclines. Encourage students to do the investigation twice to check if the same thing happens again.

#### Activity Components  
• Instruction box (Step 3): “Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.”  
• Observe box.  
• Draw canvas – *“Draw and label what happened.”*  
• Rive animation (*alt text:* *A hand holds up a ramp with three different material surfaces, text says "Lift the ramp".*)

---

### 1d. Sub-section u – Explain (Section iY35BNTaNrNW)

#### Teaching Notes  
Students state which surface required the smallest tilt to make a block slide and which needed a greater tilt. They explain their reasoning around why they think this happened. Prompting questions:  
• “Why do you think a small lift was enough on one surface but not another?”  
• “What do your observations tell you about different materials?”

#### Activity Components  
• Explain box.  
• Response prompts and exemplar answers:  
  – “Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?” → “Foil surface needed the lowest lift.”  
  – “Which ramp surface needed the greatest [tilt] to make a block slide?” → “Sandpaper needed the highest lift.”  
  – “Why do you think that is?”  
    Sample answers:  
    • “It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.”  
    • “It is the roughest material and slows the block down.”  
• Instruction box (Step 4): “Record your results.”

## 2. Friction Sentence Builders  (Teacher page – Section 754uXFtDskJZ)

| Approx. time | 10 min |
|--------------|--------|

### Teaching Notes  
Students complete sentences, using the word bank to describe different levels of friction. They then write their own simple sentence explaining how friction operates on another type of surface. Have them read their sentences aloud to confirm differences in friction. Students may want to use their investigation as inspiration for their own sentence.

### Activity Components  
1. **Statement box** – **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  
2. **Plain text** – “Read the eBook to learn more.”  
3. **eBook** stimulus (for class reading).  
4. **Word bank** coloured boxes: rough, bumpy, smooth, weak, strong.  
5. **Fill-in-the-blanks 1**  
   Sentence: “Sandpaper has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.”  
   Answers: *rough* | *strong*  
6. **Fill-in-the-blanks 2**  
   Sentence: “Ice has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.”  
   Answers: *smooth* | *weak*  
7. **Free response** – “Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.”  
   Example: “Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.”

## 3. Opposing Forces  (Teacher page – Section UYQVs5naAF8K)

| Approx. time | 10 min |
|--------------|--------|

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force that moves an object. Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work. Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their understanding that friction always works against movement.

### Activity Components  
1. **Statement box** – “Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to  the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.”  
2. **Coloured box** – “We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.”  
3. **Discussion responses**  
   • “Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?” – sample answer: “Friction is usually a weaker force than the push force moving the box.”  
   • “In which direction is friction working in?” – sample answer: “Friction is working in the opposite direction to the push.”  
   • “In which direction is the box being pushed?” – sample answer: “Forward, the same direction as the longer movement arrow.”  
4. **Rive animation** (*alt text:* *A child joyfully sits in a cardboard box, pushed by an adult, illustrating friction and movement.*)

---

### 3a. Sub-section V – Draw the Arrows (Section G4biyyVUT93Q)

#### Teaching Notes  
Students draw and label two arrows: one to show the force moving the object and another to show the friction acting against it. Encourage them to make the stronger force longer and the weaker force shorter to show which one has more effect. Remind them that the arrows should point in opposite directions.

#### Activity Components  
• Drawing canvas with four panels image (*alt text:* *Four panels: a boy sliding, a woman shopping, a girl on a scooter, and a boy raking leaves.*)  
  Instructions:  
  – Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
  – Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
  – Label your arrows as “movement” and “friction”.  
• Model answer image is supplied in suggested answers.

## 4. Shoes & Friction  (Student page – Section Hnj3ST7v1QZ9)

| Approx. time | 10 min |
|--------------|--------|

### Teaching Notes  
Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed for and what surfaces they are used on.

### Activity Components  
1. **Statement box** – “When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. … The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.”  
2. **Image of four shoes** (*alt text:* *Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.*)  
3. **Table to complete** – “Look at the shoes. Then complete the table.”  
   Columns: Shoes | For what type of activity are the shoes designed? | For what type of surface are the shoes designed?  
   (See suggested answers list for exemplars.)  

---

### 4a. Sub-section V – Which Shoe Has Most / Least Friction? (Section iaKAeYV2qReD)

#### Teaching Notes  
Students identify which shoes provide the most and least friction and justify their answers.

#### Activity Components  
• Image repeat of the four shoes (alt text as above).  
• Response prompts:  
  – “Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?”  
    Example: “Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.”  
  – “Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?”  
    Example: “Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.”  
• Drawing canvas – “Think of a time when you have or you might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.”

## 5. Design a Special Shoe  (Student page – Section n0uN9MH9vm7B)

| Approx. time | 15 min |
|--------------|--------|

### Teaching Notes  
Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer. Have them present their drawings to show their understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.  
(This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's ability to describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction.)

### Activity Components  
1. **Instruction (draw canvas)** – “Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it. Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.”  
2. **Idea prompt image** (*alt text:* *A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground, with footprints nearby.*)  
3. **Statement box** – “Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop.”  
4. **Light-bulb helper image** (*alt text:* *A cheerful cartoon light bulb character with big eyes and a pointing finger.*)
