**Focus Question**  
What slows an object down?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, “What slows an object down?” Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Section 1: Investigation – How surfaces affect sliding  

### Teaching Notes  
Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why. It may be beneficial to have sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap available for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect each block's movement. Encourage the use of words such as *bumpy*, *lumpy*, *rough* and *smooth*.

### 1.1 Investigation Setup  
With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.

**Materials**  
Each pair will need:  
- A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
- Three identical small block-shaped objects  

*(Image: Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.)*

**Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?**

#### Teaching Notes  
Explain to students they will be working in pairs to investigate how different surfaces affect how an object slides. Read through the materials list together and assist students to collect what they need.  
Possible materials for covering the ramp are:  
- Rough sandpaper  
- Aluminium foil  
- Bubble wrap  
- Felt  
- Carpet  
- Astro turf  
- Velcro  
- Plastic wrap

### 1.2 Prediction  
**Steps**  
1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, making sure they are lined up.

On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?  
On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?

*(“Predict” indicator.)*

#### Teaching Notes  
Students follow the steps of the investigation by first setting up a ramp using three different materials, and placing a block on each surface. Discuss how to make sure all three blocks start from a fair place on the ramp. It is suggested that students line the three blocks up with the back of the ramp or they could draw a line as a starting point for the blocks.  
Once the students have created their ramps, they make predictions about which surface will let the block slide first and which will slow it down the most. Ask students to record and explain their thinking.

---

### 1.3 Observation  
Draw and label what happened.  
Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.

#### Teaching Notes  
Once students have made their predictions, they begin their investigation. They gradually lift the ramp, paying close attention to when each block begins to slide. Students draw and label their observations. They may want to draw three versions of the ramp to show the inclines. Encourage students to do the investigation twice to check if the same thing happens again.

---

### 1.4 Record Results  
**Explain**  
- Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?  
- Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?  
- Why do you think that is?

#### Teaching Notes  
Students state which surface required the smallest tilt to make a block slide and which needed a greater tilt. They explain their reasoning around why they think this happened. If students need help explaining their ideas, the teacher could ask some prompting questions such as:  
- Why do you think a small lift was enough on one surface but not another?  
- What do your observations tell you about different materials?

## Section 2: Reading and Word Bank Activity  

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn that friction is the force that slows down moving things and keeps still things from moving. Read the eBook to explore the concept further, encouraging students to think of examples where friction plays a role in everyday life. Use this opportunity to link back to the investigation by asking:  
- Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?  
- When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?

### 2.1 Complete the Sentences  
Use the word bank to complete the sentences.

1. Sandpaper has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.  
2. Ice has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.

**Word bank:** rough  bumpy  smooth  weak  strong

**Answers:**  
1. Sandpaper has a **rough** surface so it makes **strong** friction.  
2. Ice has a **smooth** surface so it makes **weak** friction.

Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.  
*Model answer:* Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.

## Section 3: Exploring Shoes  

### Teaching Notes  
Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed for and what surfaces they are used on.

### 3.1 Identify Shoe Uses  
When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. The surface you move on and the soles (bottoms) of your shoes are always touching and rubbing together. The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.

*(Image: Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.)*

**Activity:** Look at the shoes. Then complete the table.

| Shoes | Activity Designed For   | Surface Designed For                 |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A     | Climbing or hiking      | Ice or snow                          |
| B     | Ballet dancing          | Smooth wooden stage floors           |
| C     | Football games          | Grass                                |
| D     | Rollerskating           | Smooth paths or skating rinks        |

### 3.2 Friction Decisions  
**Explain**  
- Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
- Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  
- Draw the shoes.

*(Image: Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.)*

#### Teaching Notes  
Students identify which shoes provide the most and least friction and justify their answers.

**Answers:**  
- Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.  
- Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.

## Section 4: Designing New Shoes  

### Teaching Notes  
Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer. Have them present their drawings to show their understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.

**Activity:** Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.

**Think:** Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.

*(Image: A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground, with footprints nearby.)*  
_Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop._

## Section 5: Representing Friction with Arrows  

### Teaching Notes  
Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two surfaces move against each other.  
Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work. Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.

### 5.1 Discussion of Arrows  
**Statement:** Friction always works in the *opposite* direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  
We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.

**Discuss:**  
- Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?  
- In which direction is friction working?  
- In which direction is the box being pushed?

*(Rive animation: A child joyfully sits in a cardboard box, pushed by an adult, illustrating friction and movement.)*

---

### 5.2 Drawing Arrows  
Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
Label your arrows as **movement** and **friction**.
