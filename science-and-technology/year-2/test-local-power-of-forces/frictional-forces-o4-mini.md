# Lesson: Frictional Forces  
**URL:** https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6282-frictional-forces  
**Focus Question:** What slows an object down?

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

## Note: Vocabulary Words  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and Tier 3 words (low-frequency, subject-specific). Instruction should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** throughout the lesson.

## Introduction  
**Show students the image** (A child pushes a wooden cart with a happy puppy sitting inside on a carpeted floor. – alt text) and ask the focus question, **What slows an object down?**  
- Ask students to think of times they have observed an object slowing down or stopping (e.g., a rolling ball on grass, a toy car on a track) and consider what caused it to slow.  
- Document responses to gauge current understanding and identify misconceptions.

# Section 1 (Teacher-Led Investigation)  
**Which block will slide down the ramp first? Explain your thinking.** (Think-Pair-Share)  

### Materials  
Each pair will need:  
- A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials (e.g., sandpaper, aluminium foil, bubble wrap).  
- Three identical small block-shaped objects.

_(Image: Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.)_  

### Teaching Notes  
1. Introduce the concept of friction by presenting the ramp with three different surfaces. Encourage students to feel and compare sandpaper, foil and bubble wrap. Use words such as **bumpy**, **rough** and **smooth**.  
2. Ask: “Which block will slide down the ramp first? Why?” (Think-Pair-Share)  
3. Explain they will work in pairs. Review materials list and help them collect what they need.  
4. Steps of the investigation:  
   a. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
   b. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, lined up.  
   c. Predict: On which surface will a block slide first? Why? On which will it slide last? Why? (record responses)  
   d. Slowly and steadily lift the ramp until all blocks slide. Watch how each block moves.  
   e. Record results: Which surface needed the smallest tilt? Which needed the greatest? Why?  
   f. Repeat the investigation to check consistency.  
5. After completing the investigation, ask:  
   - “Why do you think a small lift was enough on one surface but not another?”  
   - “What do your observations tell you about different materials?”  
6. Revisit the focus question: “What slows an object down?” Ask volunteers to share and address any remaining misconceptions.

### Student Responses & Answers  
- Prediction: The block on the **foil** will slide first because the foil’s smooth surface has fewer bumps and is easier to move over.  
- Prediction: The block on the **sandpaper** will slide last because its bumpy surface slows it down.  
- Observation: Foil surface needed the **lowest** lift to make the block slide.  
- Observation: Sandpaper needed the **highest** lift.  
- Explanation: “It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.”  
- Explanation: “It is the roughest material and slows the block down.”

# Section 2 (Teacher-Led eBook Exploration)  
### Friction Definition Statement  
> **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.

### Activity: Read the eBook  
_Read the eBook to learn more about friction._  

### Teaching Notes (Checkpoint)  
- Encourage students to think of everyday examples where friction plays a role (e.g., shoes on different floors, brakes on a bicycle).  
- Ask:  
  - “Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?”  
  - “When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?”

# Section 3 (Student-Led Vocabulary & Sentences)  
## Use the word bank to complete the sentences. Then write your own.  

**Word Bank:** rough, bumpy, smooth, weak, strong

1. Sandpaper has a **___** surface so it makes **___** friction.  
2. Ice has a **___** surface so it makes **___** friction.  
3. Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.

### Teaching Notes (Checkpoint)  
- Students complete the sentences, using evidence from the investigation and eBook.  
- Have students read their sentences aloud to confirm understanding of different levels of friction.

### Answers  
1. Sandpaper has a **rough** surface so it makes **strong** friction.  
2. Ice has a **smooth** surface so it makes **weak** friction.  
3. Example: “Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.”

# Section 4 (Teacher-Led Force Arrows)  
### Key Statements  
- **Friction always works in the opposite direction** to the force moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  
- We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.

### Activity & Discussion (Checkpoint)  
1. Display an animation or diagram showing a box being pushed and an opposing friction arrow.  
2. Ask:  
   - “Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?”  
   - “In which direction is friction working?”  
   - “In which direction is the box being pushed?”

### Teaching Notes  
- Explain that arrow length represents force strength: the push is stronger, so its arrow is longer.  
- Emphasize friction always opposes movement.

### Expected Responses  
- Friction arrow is shorter because friction is weaker than the applied force.  
- Friction acts opposite to the direction of push.  
- The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer movement arrow.

# Section 5 (Student-Led Arrow Drawing)  
**Draw one arrow to show the direction of movement and another to show the force of friction. Label them “movement” and “friction.”**  

_(Image: Four panels: a boy sliding, a woman shopping, a girl on a scooter, and a boy raking leaves.)_  

### Teaching Notes  
- Encourage students to draw longer arrows for stronger forces and shorter arrows for weaker forces.  
- Remind them arrows must point in opposite directions.

### Answers  
An example answer illustrates each panel with two arrows: one in the direction of the activity movement (longer) and one opposing it (shorter), each labeled.

# Section 6 (Student-Led Shoe Exploration)  
**When you walk, run or slide, friction is at work. The surface you move on and the soles of your shoes are always touching and rubbing together.**  

### Activity  
Look at the four pairs of sports footwear below and complete the table:

| Shoes | For what activity? | For what surface? |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| A     |                    |                   |
| B     |                    |                   |
| C     |                    |                   |
| D     |                    |                   |

_(Image alt text: Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.)_

### Teaching Notes  
- Students decide each shoe’s purpose and typical surface.  
- Prompt them to consider design features (spikes, smooth soles, wheels).

### Answers  
- A (crampons): Climbing or hiking – Ice or snow  
- B (ballet shoes): Ballet dancing – Smooth wooden stage floors  
- C (football boots): Football games – Grass  
- D (rollerblades): Rollerskating – Smooth paths or skating rinks

# Section 7 (Student-Led Friction Judgments)  
1. Which shoes provide the **most** friction? How do you know?  
2. Which shoes provide the **least** friction? How do you know?

### Teaching Notes  
- Students justify using evidence (soles, spikes, wheels).

### Answers  
- Most friction: **Shoes A (crampons)** because sharp spikes dig into ice for a very strong grip.  
- Least friction: **Shoes D (rollerblades)** because wheels reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.

# Section 8 (Student-Led Design)  
**Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.**  
> *Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.*

### Teaching Notes  
- Encourage creativity and label features (e.g., tread pattern, sole material).  
- Have students present drawings, explaining how friction is tailored to the activity.

### Responses  
Varied by student; no fixed answer.
