## 3. Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
> Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

**Surface texture and friction**  
> All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

## 5. Introduction  
**Show students the image and ask the focus question, “What slows an object down?”**  
> Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## 7. Lesson Overview & Activities  

### Activity 1: Investigating How Surfaces Affect Sliding  
**Type:** Teacher-led investigation (20 minutes)  
**Differentiation:** 1  

#### A. Materials & Setup  
- A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials (rough sandpaper, aluminium foil, bubble wrap, felt, carpet, astro turf, velcro, plastic wrap)  
- Three identical small block-shaped objects  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: materials-needed & activity-description)*

#### B. Introduction to Investigation  
*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why. It may be beneficial to have **sandpaper**, **aluminium foil** and **bubble wrap** available for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect each block's movement. Encourage the use of words such as **bumpy**, **lumpy**, **rough** and **smooth**.

#### C. Working in Pairs  
*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Explain to students they will be working in pairs to investigate how different surfaces affect how an object slides. Read through the materials list together and assist students to collect what they need.

#### D. Predictions  
*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Once the students have created their ramps, they make predictions about which surface will let the block slide first and which will slow it down the most. Ask students to record and explain their thinking.

**Student Responses & Suggested Answers:**  
1. **Which block will slide down the ramp first? Why?**  
   - *Suggested Answer:*  
     > The block on the foil will slide first because the foil’s smooth surface has fewer bumps than the others and it is easier for the block to move over it.  
2. **Which block will slide down the ramp last? Why?**  
   - *Suggested Answer:*  
     > It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.  

*(Exact student questions & language)*

#### E. Conduct the Investigation  
*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Once students have made their predictions, they begin their investigation. They gradually lift the ramp, paying close attention to when each block begins to slide. Students draw and label their observations. They may want to draw three versions of the ramp to show the inclines. Encourage students to do the investigation twice to check if the same thing happens again.

#### F. Recording Results  
*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students state which surface required the smallest tilt to make a block slide and which needed a greater tilt. They explain their reasoning around why they think this happened. If students need help explaining their ideas, the teacher could ask some prompting questions such as:  
> • Why do you think a small lift was enough on one surface but not another?  
> • What do your observations tell you about different materials?

**Recording Prompts & Suggested Answers:**  
1. **Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?**  
   - *Suggested Answer:*  
     > The foil surface needed the lowest lift.  
2. **Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?**  
   - *Suggested Answer:*  
     > Sandpaper needed the highest lift.  
3. **Why do you think that is?**  
   - *Suggested Answers:*  
     > • It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.  
     > • It is the roughest material and slows the block down.

#### G. Discussing Forces  
*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students learn that friction always acts in the **opposite** direction to the force that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two surfaces move against each other. Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work. Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.

### Checkpoint 1: Read the eBook  
**Type:** Teacher-guided reading (10 minutes)  
**Checkpoint:** ✔︎  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students learn that friction is the force that slows down moving things and keeps still things from moving. Read the eBook to explore the concept further, encouraging students to think of examples where friction plays a role in everyday life. Use this opportunity to link back to the investigation by asking:  
> • Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?  
> • When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?

**Student Task:** Read the eBook and discuss.

### Activity 2: Exploring Different Shoes  
**Type:** Student exploration (10 minutes)  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed for and what surfaces they are used on.

**Task:** Look at images of four pairs of sports footwear—A) crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades—then complete a table:  
- For what type of activity are the shoes designed?  
- For what type of surface are the shoes designed?  

**Suggested Table Answers:**  
| Shoes | Activity            | Surface                   |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| A     | Climbing or hiking  | Ice or snow               |
| B     | Ballet dancing      | Smooth wooden stage floor |
| C     | Football games      | Grass                     |
| D     | Rollerskating       | Smooth paths or rinks     |

### Activity 3: Identifying Friction Strength in Shoes  
**Type:** Student response (10 minutes)  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students identify which shoes provide the most and least friction and justify their answers.

**Questions & Suggested Answers:**  
1. **Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?**  
   > Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.  
2. **Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?**  
   > Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.

### Activity 4: Designing a New Shoe  
**Type:** Student draw & label (15 minutes)  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer.

**Task:** Draw and label your shoe. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.  
*(Open-ended; no fixed answers.)*

### Checkpoint 2: Representing Friction with Arrows  
**Type:** Teacher demonstration & student discussion (10 minutes)  
**Checkpoint:** ✔︎  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students learn that friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down. We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.

**Discussion Questions & Suggested Answers:**  
1. **Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?**  
   > Friction is usually a weaker force than the push force moving the box, so it shows that friction tries to slow the box down but is not as strong as the push of the man.  
2. **In which direction is friction working in?**  
   > Friction is working in the opposite direction to the direction the box is being pushed.  
3. **In which direction is the box being pushed?**  
   > The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer movement arrow.

### Activity 5: Drawing Forces in Everyday Contexts  
**Type:** Student draw (10 minutes)  

*(Exact Teaching Note – category: activity-description)*  
> Students draw and label two arrows for each cartoon: one to show the direction of the movement, and another to show the direction of the force of friction. Label the arrows “movement” and “friction.”

**Task:** Four-panel cartoon (sliding boy; woman pushing cart; girl on scooter; boy raking leaves).  
*(Open-ended; sample answer provided as an overlay image.)*
