## Focus Question  
**What slows an object down?**  

---

## Introduction  
Show students the image and ask the focus question, “What slows an object down?” Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.  

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.  

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

# Lesson Activities  

## 1. Planning the Investigation  
**Section:** Teacher-led instruction (Section D5yjZPvU2kn5)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Differentiation:** 1  

**Activity**  
“With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Explain to students they will be working in pairs to investigate how different surfaces affect how an object slides. Read through the materials list together and assist students to collect what they need.  

> **Materials**  
> Each pair will need:  
> - A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
> - Three identical small block-shaped objects  

> **Possible materials for covering the ramp are:**  
> Rough sandpaper; Aluminium foil; Bubble wrap; Felt; Carpet; Astro turf; Velcro; Plastic wrap

## 2. Predicting Slides  
**Section:** Student predictions (Section HwGQYsChJw0u)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Differentiation:** 1  

**Activity**  
1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, making sure they are lined up.  

> **Instructions**  
> On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?  
> On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?  

> **Prompt for students:**  
> *Predict*  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students follow the steps of the investigation by first setting up a ramp using three different materials, and placing a block on each surface. Discuss how to make sure all three blocks start from a fair place on the ramp (e.g., line them up with the back of the ramp or draw a starting line). Once the students have created their ramps, they make predictions about which surface will let the block slide first and which will slow it down the most. Ask students to record and explain their thinking.  

**Model Answers**  
- *First slide:* “It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has less bumps than the others and it is easier for the block to move over it.”  
- *Last slide:* “It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.”

## 3. Observing the Slides  
**Section:** Student observation (Section 3qErgzDZrkLm)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Differentiation:** 1  

**Activity**  
3. Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.  

> **Instructions**  
> Draw and label what happened.  

> **Prompt for students:**  
> *Observe*  

**Teaching Notes**  
Once students have made their predictions, they begin their investigation. They gradually lift the ramp, paying close attention to when each block begins to slide. Students draw and label their observations. They may want to draw three versions of the ramp to show the different inclines. Encourage students to do the investigation twice to check if the same thing happens again.

## 4. Explaining Results  
**Section:** Student explanation (Section iY35BNTaNrNW)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Differentiation:** 1  

**Activity**  
4. Record your results.  

> **Instructions**  
> - Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?  
> - Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?  
> - Why do you think that is? (for each surface)  

> **Prompt for students:**  
> *Explain*  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students state which surface required the smallest tilt to make a block slide and which needed a greater tilt. They explain their reasoning around why they think this happened. If students need help explaining their ideas, prompt with questions such as:  
- “Why do you think a small lift was enough on one surface but not another?”  
- “What do your observations tell you about different materials?”  

**Model Answers**  
- Smallest tilt: “The foil surface needed the lowest lift.”  
- Greatest tilt: “Sandpaper needed the highest lift.”  
- Reason for foil: “It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.”  
- Reason for sandpaper: “It is the roughest material and slows the block down.”

## 5. Reading the eBook  
**Section:** Teacher-led eBook exploration (Section 754uXFtDskJZ)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**CheckPoint:** Yes  

**Activity**  
Read the eBook to learn more.  

> **Statement**  
> Friction is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that friction is the force that slows down moving things and keeps still things from moving. Read the eBook to explore the concept further, encouraging students to think of examples where friction plays a role in everyday life. Use this opportunity to link back to the investigation by asking:  
- “Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?”  
- “When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?”

## 6. Word Bank Sentences  
**Section:** Student language practice (Section BRJxXCQiWhWX)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**CheckPoint:** Yes  

**Activity**  
Use the word bank to complete the sentences. Then write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.  

> **Sentences**  
> 1. Sandpaper has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.  
> 2. Ice has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.  

> **Word bank:** rough bumpy smooth weak strong  

> **Instruction:** Explain  

> **Prompt for students:**  
> Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students complete sentences using the word bank to describe different levels of friction. They then write their own simple sentence explaining how friction operates on another type of surface. Have them read their sentences aloud to confirm differences in friction. Students may want to use their investigation as inspiration for their own sentence.  

**Model Answers**  
1. “Sandpaper has a **rough** surface so it makes **strong** friction.”  
2. “Ice has a **smooth** surface so it makes **weak** friction.”

## 7. Introducing Friction Arrows  
**Section:** Teacher-led discussion (Section UYQVs5naAF8K)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**CheckPoint:** Yes  

**Activity**  
Discuss how to represent friction with arrows.  

> **Statement**  
> Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  

> **Note**  
> We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.  

> **Discussion Questions**  
> 1. Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?  
> 2. In which direction is friction working?  
> 3. In which direction is the box being pushed?  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two surfaces move against each other. Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work. Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.  

**Model Answers**  
1. “Friction is usually a weaker force than the push force moving the box, so it shows that friction tries to slow the box down but is not as strong as the push of the man.”  
2. “Friction is working in the opposite direction to the direction the box is being pushed.”  
3. “The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer green movement arrow.”

## 8. Applying Arrows in Context  
**Section:** Student drawing (Section G4biyyVUT93Q)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  

**Activity**  
Draw one panel to show the direction of movement and one arrow for friction in each of four cartoons. Label your arrows as “movement” and “friction.”  

> **Instructions**  
> - Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
> - Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
> - Label your arrows as “movement” and “friction.”  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students draw and label two arrows: one to show the force moving the object and another to show the friction acting against it. Encourage them to make the stronger force longer and the weaker force shorter to show which one has more effect. Remind them that the arrows should point in opposite directions to show that friction works against movement.  

**Model Answer**  
_Provided as an overlay on the original four-panel illustration (movement and friction arrows correctly drawn and labeled in each panel)._

## 10. Identifying Most and Least Friction in Footwear  
**Section:** Student justification (Section iaKAeYV2qReD)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Differentiation:** 2  

**Activity**  
- Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
- Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  
- Think of a time when you have or might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.  

> **Prompt:** Think about how shoe design (e.g., crampons, wheels) affects friction.  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students identify which shoes provide the most and least friction and justify their answers. Then they design and draw a shoe for a special surface or activity.  

**Model Answers**  
- Most friction: “Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.”  
- Least friction: “Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.”

## 11. Designing a Shoe for Friction  
**Section:** Student design (Section n0uN9MH9vm7B)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Differentiation:** 3  

**Activity**  
Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.  

> **Instruction:**  
> Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.  

**Teaching Notes**  
Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer. Have them present their drawings to show their understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.  

**Visual**
