**Focus Question:**  
> What slows an object down?

## Note  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction for these words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.

## Introduction  
Show students the image of a child pushing a wooden cart with a puppy on a carpeted floor. Ask:  
> What slows an object down?  
Have students think of times they observed a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and what caused it to slow. Document responses to gauge understanding and misconceptions.

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
> Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.  

**Surface texture and friction**  
> All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

# Lesson Sequence

The lesson is organized into five main sections, each with teacher guidance and corresponding student activities.

---

## Section 1 (Teacher)  
**Activity:** Investigating how different surfaces affect sliding  
**Duration:** 20 min  

### Teaching Notes  
- **Introduction to concept:**  
  “Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why. It may be beneficial to have **sandpaper**, **aluminium foil** and **bubble wrap** available for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect each block’s movement. Encourage the use of words such as *bumpy*, *lumpy*, *rough* and *smooth*.”

- **Explain investigation setup:**  
  “Explain to students they will be working in pairs to investigate how different surfaces affect how an object slides. Read through the materials list together and assist students to collect what they need.”

- **Materials (each pair will need):**  
  • A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
  • Three identical small block-shaped objects  

- **Investigation steps:**  
  1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
  2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, lined up.  
  3. Predict which block will slide first and why. Record thinking.  
  4. Slowly and steadily tilt the ramp until all blocks slide. Watch how each block moves.  
  5. Draw and label observations; consider drawing three versions of the ramp to show inclines. Repeat to check consistency.  
  6. State which surface required the smallest tilt to make a block slide and which needed a greater tilt. Explain reasoning.  
     - Prompt if needed:  
       • Why do you think a small lift was enough on one surface but not another?  
       • What do your observations tell you about different materials?

### Student Activities & Answers  

#### 1. Predicting motion (Think, Pair, Share)  
**Prompt:**  
> Which block do you think will slide down the ramp first? Explain your thinking.  
**Example Answer:**  
> The block on the **foil** will slide first because the foil’s smooth surface has fewer bumps, making it easier for the block to move.

---

#### 2. Prediction: last slide  
**Prompt:**  
> On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?  
**Example Answer:**  
> It will slide last on the **roughest** surface (sandpaper) because the bumps slow it down the most.

---

#### 3. Observation drawing  
**Prompt:**  
> Draw and label what happened when you lifted the ramp.  
*(No fixed answer – students’ drawings will vary.)*

---

#### 4. Record results  
**Prompts & Answers:**  
- **Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?**  
  > The foil surface needed the lowest lift.  
- **Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?**  
  > Sandpaper needed the highest lift.  
- **Why do you think that is?**  
  > It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.  
- **Why do you think that is?**  
  > It is the roughest material and slows the block down.

## Section 2 (Teacher → Student)  
**Activity:** Read and discuss the eBook  
**Duration:** 10 min  

### Teacher Guidance  
- **Statement:**  
  > **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  
- **Prompt:**  
  > Read the eBook to learn more.  

### Student Activity: Vocabulary & Sentence Completion  
**Instructions:**  
> Use the word bank to complete the sentences.  

Word bank (displayed as coloured boxes):  
- rough | bumpy | smooth | weak | strong  

1. “Sandpaper has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.”  
   - Answers: **rough**, **strong**  

2. “Ice has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.”  
   - Answers: **smooth**, **weak**  

3. “Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.”  
   *(No fixed answer – students compose their own.)*

## Section 3 (Teacher)  
**Activity:** Representing friction with arrows  
**Duration:** 10 min  

### Teaching Notes  
- **Statement:**  
  > Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  
- **Note:**  
  > We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.

### Student Discussion & Demonstration  
1. **Discussion:**  
   - Why is the friction arrow shorter than the movement arrow?  
     > Friction is usually a weaker force than the applied push, so the friction arrow is shorter to show it has less effect.  
   - In which direction is friction working?  
     > Friction works opposite to the direction of motion.  
   - In which direction is the box being pushed?  
     > The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer movement arrow.

2. **Animation:**  
   - View the “Movement vs. Friction” animation showing a child in a cardboard box being pushed.

3. **Drawing Activity:**  
   **Prompt:**  
   > Draw one arrow to show the direction of movement and another arrow to show the direction of friction. Label them “movement” and “friction.”  
   *(Example answer provided as an image with arrows.)*

## Section 4 (Student)  
**Activity:** Exploring friction in footwear  
**Duration:** 10 min  

### Teacher Prompt  
> Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed for and what surfaces they are used on.

### Student Activity: Shoes Table  
**Instructions:**  
> Look at the four pairs of sports footwear labelled A – D. Complete the table:

| Shoes | Activity design | Surface design |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| A     | Climbing or hiking | Ice or snow |
| B     | Ballet dancing     | Smooth wooden stage floors |
| C     | Football games     | Grass |
| D     | Rollerskating      | Smooth paths or skating rinks |

**Extension Questions:**  
- Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
  > Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the spikes dig into ice or snow.  
- Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  
  > Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily.

## Section 5 (Student)  
**Activity:** Designing a specialized shoe  
**Duration:** 15 min  

### Prompt & Inspiration  
> Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.  
*(Image of snowshoes and ice skates provided.)*

### Task  
> Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.

*(No fixed answer – students’ designs will vary.)*
