## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.  

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.  

## Note (Vocabulary)  
**Vocabulary Words**  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. Instruction should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in **bold** within the lesson.  

## Teacher Reading  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.  

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.  

## Introduction  
Show students the image (child pushing cart) and ask the focus question:  
> **What slows an object down?**  
Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping—such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track—and consider what caused it to slow down. Record their responses to gauge their current understanding and identify any misconceptions.

## Section 1: Investigating Friction (Teacher-led)  
**Look at the three different surfaces on this ramp. _Think, Pair, Share._**  
**Discussion:**  
> Which block do you think will slide down the ramp first?  
> Explain your thinking.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Introduce the concept of friction with a cardboard ramp covered in three different materials (e.g., bubble wrap, aluminium foil, sandpaper). Have sandpaper, foil and bubble wrap available to feel. Ask students to predict which block will slide first and why, using words such as _bumpy, rough,_ and _smooth._  
*(High-impact strategies: collaboration, multiple exposures, questioning)*  

### 1.1 Planning the Investigation  
> With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.  

**Materials**  
- A ramp: a piece of cardboard with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
- Three identical small block-shaped objects  

> Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?  

---

### 1.2 Prediction  
**Predict**  
1. On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?  
   - *Suggested Answer:*  
     It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has fewer bumps and it is easier for the block to move over it.  
2. On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?  
   - *Suggested Answer:*  
     It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students set up the ramp and blocks, line them up fairly, then record and explain their predictions.  

---

### 1.3 Observing the Investigation  
**Observe**  
3. Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.  

> Draw and label what happened.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Once predictions are made, students lift the ramp gradually, observe when blocks begin to slide, and draw their observations (three versions of the ramp incline). Encourage repeating the investigation.  

---

### 1.4 Recording Results  
**Explain**  
- Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?  
  - *Suggested Answer:* The foil surface needed the lowest lift.  
- Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?  
  - *Suggested Answer:* Sandpaper needed the highest lift.  
- Why do you think that is?  
  - *Suggested Answers:*  
    - Foil is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.  
    - Sandpaper is the roughest material and slows the block down.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Ask prompting questions if needed:  
- Why did a small lift work on one surface but not another?  
- What do your observations tell you about different materials?

## Section 2: Exploring Friction in the eBook (Teacher-led)  
> Read the eBook to learn more.  

**Statement:**  
> **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students read the eBook, think of everyday examples of friction, then link back to the investigation by asking:  
- Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?  
- When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?  

---

### 2.1 Vocabulary and Practice (Student)  
> Use the word bank to complete the sentences.  

1. Sandpaper has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.  
   - *Answers:* rough, strong  
2. Ice has a ____ surface so it makes ____ friction.  
   - *Answers:* smooth, weak  

> Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.  
- *Example Response:* Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students complete sentences with the word bank, then write and read their own sentence about friction on another surface.

## Section 3: Representing Friction with Arrows (Teacher-led)  
**Statement:**  
> Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  
> We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Explain that friction is a force created when two surfaces move against each other. Direct attention to two arrows: one for movement, one for friction. Discuss why the friction arrow is smaller (weaker force) and that it points opposite to movement.  

---

### 3.1 Discussion (Student)  
1. Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?  
   - *Suggested Response:* Friction is usually weaker than the force pushing the box, so it shows friction slows the box but is not as strong as the push.  
2. In which direction is friction working?  
   - *Suggested Response:* Opposite to the direction the box is being pushed.  
3. In which direction is the box being pushed?  
   - *Suggested Response:* Forward, in the same direction as the longer movement arrow.  

---

### 3.2 Application (Student)  
> Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
> Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
> Label your arrows “movement” and “friction.”  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw and label two arrows: the stronger force longer (movement) and the weaker force shorter (friction), pointing in opposite directions.

## Section 4: Everyday Examples – Shoes (Student)  
> When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. The surface you move on and the soles (bottoms) of your shoes are always touching and rubbing together. The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.  

---

### 4.1 Identifying Design and Surface  
> Look at the shoes. Then complete the table.  

| Shoes | Activity Design | Surface Design |
|:-----:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| A     | Climbing or hiking                      | Ice or snow                              |
| B     | Ballet dancing                          | Smooth wooden stage floors               |
| C     | Football games                          | Grass                                    |
| D     | Rollerskating                           | Smooth paths or skating rinks            |

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore different shoes and decide their activity and surface design.  

---

### 4.2 Friction Ranking and Justification  
1. Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
   - *Suggested Answer:* Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.  
2. Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  
   - *Suggested Answer:* Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.  
3. Think of a time when you have or might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students identify and justify most/least friction shoes, then draw a shoe design for a chosen surface/activity.  

---

## Section 5: Designing Footwear (Student)  
> Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.  
> *Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.*  

**Example Statement:**  
> Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop.  

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students design, label and describe a shoe for a special surface or activity, considering friction needs. They present their drawings to demonstrate understanding of friction’s role.
