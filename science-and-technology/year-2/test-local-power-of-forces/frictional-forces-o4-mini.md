## Focus Question  
**What slows an object down?**

---

## Introduction  
_Show students the image below and ask the focus question, “What slows an object down?” Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding and identify any misconceptions._

## Teacher Reading (Teacher Knowledge)  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

## Section 1: Investigating Friction on a Ramp (Teacher & Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why. It may be beneficial to have sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap available for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect each block’s movement. Encourage the use of words such as _bumpy_, _lumpy_, _rough_ and _smooth_.

### Materials Needed  
- Cardboard ramp with three equal-sized surfaces of different materials  
- Three identical small block-shaped objects  
- Samples of covering materials:  
  - Rough sandpaper  
  - Aluminium foil  
  - Bubble wrap  
  - Felt  
  - Carpet  
  - Astro turf  
  - Velcro  
  - Plastic wrap  

### Student Steps  
1. **Predict**  
   - On which surface will a block slide first? Why?  
   - On which surface will a block slide last? Why?  
2. **Investigate**  
   - Line up the three blocks at one end of the ramp, each on a different surface.  
   - Slowly and steadily lift the ramp until all blocks slide.  
3. **Observe & Draw**  
   - Draw and label what happened as each block slid.  
4. **Record Results**  
   - Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?  
   - Which surface needed the greatest tilt?  
   - Explain your thinking.

### Suggested Answers  
- **First slide:**  
  “It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has fewer bumps than the others and it is easier for the block to move over it.”  
- **Last slide:**  
  “It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.”  
- **Smallest tilt:**  
  “The foil surface needed the lowest lift.”  
- **Greatest tilt:**  
  “Sandpaper needed the highest lift.”  
- **Why smallest tilt?**  
  “It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.”  
- **Why greatest tilt?**  
  “It is the roughest material and slows the block down.”

## Section 2: Reading & Defining Friction (Teacher)

**Activity:** Read the eBook to learn more about friction (10 minutes, checkpoint)  
**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that friction is the force that slows down moving things and keeps still things from moving. Read the eBook to explore the concept further, encouraging students to think of examples where friction plays a role in everyday life. Use this opportunity to link back to the investigation by asking:  
- Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?  
- When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?

### Teacher Actions  
- Display and read from the eBook.  
- Highlight the statement:  
  > **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  
- Facilitate a discussion of everyday examples of friction.

## Section 3: Describing Friction Levels (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students complete sentences, using the word bank to describe different levels of friction. They then write their own simple sentence explaining how friction operates on another type of surface. Have them read their sentences aloud to confirm differences in friction. Students may want to use their investigation as inspiration for their own sentence.

### Student Activity (Checkpoint)  
1. **Use the word bank to complete the sentences.**  
   - Sandpaper has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.  
     - _Suggested answers:_ **rough**, **strong**  
   - Ice has a ___ surface so it makes ___ friction.  
     - _Suggested answers:_ **smooth**, **weak**  
2. **Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.**  
   - _Suggested example:_ “Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.”

## Section 4: Exploring Friction with Shoes (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed for and what surfaces they are used on.

### Student Activity  
**Look at the shoes. Then complete the table.**  

| Shoes | For what type of activity are the shoes designed? | For what type of surface are the shoes designed? |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **A** | Climbing or hiking | Ice or snow |
| **B** | Ballet dancing | Smooth wooden stage floors |
| **C** | Football games | Grass |
| **D** | Rollerskating | Smooth paths or skating rinks |

**Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?**  
> _Suggested answer:_ “Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.”

**Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?**  
> _Suggested answer:_ “Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.”

**Think of a time when you have or you might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.**  
_(Student drawings vary.)_

## Section 5: Designing for Friction (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer. Have them present their drawings to show their understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.

### Student Activity  
**Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.**  
> Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.

_Images to inspire:_  
- Snowshoes on snow-covered ground  
- Ice skates with thin metal blade and bumpy toe pick  

_(Student designs vary.)_

## Section 6: Representing Friction as a Force (Teacher)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two surfaces move against each other. Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work. Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.

### Teacher Demonstration  
1. Display the statement:  
   > **Friction always works in the opposite direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.**  
2. Show an image/animation illustrating movement and friction arrows.  
3. Pose discussion questions:  
   - **Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?**  
     > _Suggested answer:_ “Friction is usually a weaker force than the push force moving the box, so it shows that friction tries to slow the box down but is not as strong as the push of the man.”  
   - **In which direction is friction working?**  
     > _Suggested answer:_ “Friction is working in the opposite direction to the direction the box is being pushed.”  
   - **In which direction is the box being pushed?**  
     > _Suggested answer:_ “The box is being pushed forward in the same direction as the longer green movement arrow.”

## Section 7: Drawing Forces in Context (Student)

**Teaching Notes:**  
Students draw and label two arrows: one to show the force moving the object and another to show the friction acting against it. Encourage them to make the stronger force longer and the weaker force shorter to show which one has more effect. Remind them that the arrows should point in opposite directions to show that friction works against movement.

### Student Activity  
**Instructions:**  
- Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
- Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
- Label your arrows as **movement** and **friction**.

_Answer Example:_  
![Illustration showing movement and friction in various activities: sliding, shopping, scootering, grooming.](au/NVeLKaQZO7o4wv7Gx4zPeaPZ5kiR4Ntu.png)  

Students should annotate each panel with a longer “movement” arrow in the direction of motion and a shorter “friction” arrow pointing opposite.
