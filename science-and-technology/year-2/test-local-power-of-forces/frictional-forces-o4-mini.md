URL: https://www.inquisitive.com/au/lesson/6282-frictional-forces  

**Focus Question**  
What slows an object down?

---

## Introduction  
Show students the image (child pushing a wooden cart with a puppy on carpet) and ask the focus question, “What slows an object down?” Ask students to think about times they have observed or experienced an object slowing down or stopping, such as a rolling ball on grass or a toy car on a track, and consider what caused it to slow down. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

---

## Learning Intention  
Students are learning to:  
- Describe how different surfaces create varying strengths of friction and how this affects the motion of an object.

---

## Success Criteria  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Predict and explain which surfaces cause more or less friction.  
- Conduct an investigation and document observations of the effects of friction on the motion of an object.  
- Describe surfaces as smooth or rough.  
- Explain that friction is weaker on smooth surfaces and stronger on rough surfaces.  
- Use arrows to show both the strength and direction of the movement force and the opposing force of friction.  
- Use compound sentences to describe friction.

## Teacher Reading (Teacher Knowledge)  
**Friction as a force**  
Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It acts in the opposite direction to movement, causing objects to slow down or stop. This force arises due to the interactions between the microscopic bumps and grooves on surfaces.

**Surface texture and friction**  
All surfaces, even those that feel smooth, have tiny imperfections called microscopic bumps and grooves. When two surfaces slide against each other, these irregularities catch on one another, creating friction. Rougher surfaces have more pronounced bumps, leading to increased friction, while smoother surfaces generate less friction.

## Note (Vocabulary)  
Vocabulary Words  
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 2 and 3 words, which are low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson.

## Section 1: Investigating Surfaces (Teacher-Led Demonstration)  
**Teaching Note**  
Introduce the concept of friction by presenting students with a ramp featuring three different surface types. Direct their attention to the blocks at the top of the ramp and ask them to predict which block will slide down first and why. It may be beneficial to have sandpaper, aluminium foil and bubble wrap available for students to look closely at and feel. Discuss how the materials might affect each block's movement. Encourage the use of words such as bumpy, lumpy, rough and smooth.  

**Activity Setup**  
- Materials each pair needs:  
  - A ramp (cardboard) with three equal-sized strips of different materials (e.g. sandpaper, foil, bubble wrap)  
  - Three identical small block-shaped objects  

_Subsection 1.1: Planning the Investigation_  
> With a classmate, complete an investigation to answer the question.  

**Materials**  
- Three identical wooden blocks  
- Samples of craft materials: velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sandpaper, felt, plastic wrap, carpet  

![Various crafting materials including three identical wooden blocks, velcro, grass mat, foil, bubble wrap, sand paper, felt, plastic wrap and carpet.](au/pSGNdqStnDCLLNF6pHDHBTTnUH7vkd6J.jpg)  

> **Coloured Box (green)**  
> Do different surfaces affect how an object slides?  

---

_Subsection 1.2: Predicting_  
**Steps**  
1. Make a ramp with three different surfaces.  
2. Place each block on a different surface at one end of the ramp, making sure they are lined up.  

> **Coloured Box (blue)**  
> Predict  

**Student Responses**  
- On which surface do you think a block will slide first? Why?  
- On which surface do you think a block will slide last? Why?  

**Suggested Answers**  
- First: foil surface (“It will likely slide first on the foil because the foil’s smooth surface has less bumps than the others and it is easier for the block to move over it.”)  
- Last: rough sandpaper (“It will slide last on the roughest surface, usually the sandpaper, because it is bumpy and will slow the block down.”)  

**Example Animation**  
Three textured materials on a wooden surface: bubble wrap, aluminium foil, and rough sandpaper (text labels “Example”, “Bubble wrap”, “Aluminium foil”, “Rough sandpaper”).

---

_Subsection 1.3: Observing_  
> Slowly and steadily tilt the side of the ramp that has the blocks on it until all blocks have slid to the bottom. Watch how each block moves.  

> **Coloured Box (purple)**  
> Observe  

**Student Task**  
- Draw and label what happened.  

**Example Rive Animation**  
A hand holds up a ramp with three different material surfaces, text says "Lift the ramp".

---

_Subsection 1.4: Recording and Explaining_  
> 4. Record your results.  

> **Coloured Box (green)**  
> Explain  

**Student Responses**  
1. Which ramp surface needed the smallest tilt to make a block slide?  
   - Answer: foil surface (“The foil surface needed the lowest lift.”)  
2. Which ramp surface needed the greatest tilt to make a block slide?  
   - Answer: sandpaper (“Sandpaper needed the highest lift.”)  
3. Why do you think that is?  
   - For foil: “It is smoother so the block begins moving quickly.”  
   - For sandpaper: “It is the roughest material and slows the block down.”

## Section 2: Exploring the eBook (Teacher-Guided)  
> Read the eBook to learn more.  

> **Statement Box**  
> **Friction** is the force that slows down moving things and also keeps still things from moving.  

**Teaching Note**  
Students learn that friction is the force that slows down moving things and keeps still things from moving. Read the eBook to explore the concept further, encouraging students to think of examples where friction plays a role in everyday life. Use this opportunity to link back to the investigation by asking:  
- Do you think friction was happening during your investigation?  
- When did you notice friction stopping something from moving?

_Subsection 2.1: Word-Bank Sentences_  
> Use the word bank to complete the sentences.  

**Word Bank**  
- rough  ·  bumpy  ·  smooth  ·  weak  ·  strong  

**Fill-in-the-Blanks**  
1. Sandpaper has a _______ surface so it makes _______ friction.  
   - Answers: **rough**, **strong**  
2. Ice has a _______ surface so it makes _______ friction.  
   - Answers: **smooth**, **weak**  

**Then**  
- Write your own sentence about friction for another type of surface.  

_Example Answer:_  
“Foil has a smooth surface so it makes weak friction.”

**Teaching Note**  
Students complete sentences, using the word bank to describe different levels of friction. They then write their own simple sentence explaining how friction operates on another type of surface. Have them read their sentences aloud to confirm differences in friction. Students may want to use their investigation as inspiration for their own sentence.

## Section 3: Forces and Arrows (Teacher-Guided)  
> **Statement Box**  
> Friction always works in the **opposite** direction to the direction of the force that is moving an object. It always slows a moving object down.  

> **Coloured Box (grey)**  
> We can use an arrow to show the force of friction.  

**Teaching Note**  
Students learn that friction always acts in the opposite direction to the force that moves an object. It’s important for them to understand that friction is not a property that a material has on its own; it is a force created when two surfaces move against each other. Direct students’ attention to the arrows used to represent the forces at work. Students explain why they think the friction arrow is smaller, and what that suggests about the strength of friction compared to the applied force. Encourage students to identify the direction of both arrows, reinforcing their understanding that friction always works against the direction of movement.

**Discussion Prompts**  
1. Why do you think the friction arrow is shorter than the movement arrow?  
2. In which direction is friction working in?  
3. In which direction is the box being pushed?  

**Example Animation**  
A child sits in a cardboard box being pushed, with two arrows labeled “Movement” (long green) and “Friction” (short green).

---

_Subsection 3.1: Drawing Arrows_  
> - Draw one arrow to show the direction of the movement.  
> - Draw another arrow to show the direction of the force of friction.  
> - Label your arrows as 'movement' and 'friction'.  

![Four panels: a boy sliding, a woman shopping, a girl on a scooter, and a boy raking leaves.](au/JQyChCrE8hEe8Tfeq8jg8nRZavm63xpI.png)  

**Teaching Note**  
Students draw and label two arrows: one to show the force moving the object and another to show the friction acting against it. Encourage them to make the stronger force longer and the weaker force shorter to show which one has more effect. Remind them that the arrows should point in opposite directions to show that friction works against movement.

## Section 4: Shoes and Friction (Student Exploration)  
> **Statement Box**  
> When you walk, run or slide, the force of friction is at work. The surface you move on and the soles (bottoms) of your shoes are always touching and rubbing together. The soles of shoes are designed for different surfaces and activities.  

**Teaching Note**  
Students explore different shoes and decide what activities they are designed for and what surfaces they are used on.

**Image**  
Four pairs of sports footwear: A) Crampons, B) ballet shoes, C) football boots, D) rollerblades.  

| Shoes | For what type of activity are the shoes designed? | For what type of surface are the shoes designed? |
|:-----:|:-----------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
| A     | Climbing or hiking                              | Ice or snow                                     |
| B     | Ballet dancing                                  | Smooth wooden stage floors                      |
| C     | Football games                                  | Grass                                           |
| D     | Rollerskating                                   | Smooth paths or skating rinks                   |

> Look at the shoes. Then complete the table.

---

_Subsection 4.1: Most and Least Friction_  
> Which shoes provide the most friction? How do you know?  
> Which shoes provide the least friction? How do you know?  

**Suggested Answers**  
- Most: Shoes A (crampons) provide the most friction because the sharp spikes dig into ice or snow for a very strong grip.  
- Least: Shoes D (rollerblades) have wheels that reduce friction so they glide easily over smooth surfaces.  

---

_Subsection 4.2: Personal Connection_  
> Think of a time when you have or you might wear a shoe designed for a particular surface or activity. Draw the shoes.  

---

## Section 5: Designing a New Shoe (Student Creation)  
> Design a new shoe for a special place or activity. Draw and label it. Describe how each part helps the person wearing it.  

> **Coloured Box (yellow)**  
> Think of how much or how little friction your shoe will need to provide.

**Image**  
A pair of snowshoes on snow-covered ground, with footprints nearby.  

> **Statement Box**  
> Ice skates are designed to be used on ice. They have a thin metal blade that helps skaters slide on the ice and a bumpy toe pick that helps skaters stop.

![A cheerful cartoon light bulb character with big eyes and a pointing finger.](au/9gHfSqccPfgm9JqOEA4IJIaOx0fXf09o.jpg)  

**Teaching Note**  
Students design a new type of shoe for a special surface or activity, considering how much friction is needed. Encourage them to label each feature and describe how it helps the wearer. Have them present their drawings to show their understanding of friction’s role in different contexts.
