**Year:** Year 5,Year 6

**Lesson ID:** 661

**Lesson name:** Let It Grow

**Lesson duration:** 120 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Why do plants live or die?

**Focus question image:**
Wind-swept tree on a grassy hill, leaning dramatically against a blue sky backdrop.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will discover how changing the physical conditions for plants can impact their growth and survival. They will conduct an investigation to find out how different types of water affect the survival and growth of plants. Students will research First Nations Peoples' use of firestick farming, to help them understand that scientific and technological knowledge is used to solve problems and inform personal and community decisions.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask them why they think the tree looks the way it
does. Then read the focus question, 'Why do plants live or die?' Document and
use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the
topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Describe how changing physical conditions in the environment affect the
- growth and survival of plants.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of the lesson, students will:
- Explain how different types of water (e.g. salty, acidic) affect plant
- growth.
- Describe what happens when a plant doesn’t get enough light or water.
- Make predictions and compare them to what really happened.
- Use observations to support their thinking.

**TEACHER READING:**
Plants, like all living organisms, require specific conditions to thrive and
survive. Essential factors for plant growth include:

 * Sunlight: Sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis, the process by which plants
   convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of sugars. Chlorophyll,
   the pigment that gives plants their green colour, absorbs sunlight, enabling
   this energy conversion. Insufficient sunlight can lead to stunted growth,
   pale colouration and reduced overall health.

 * Water: Water is essential for transporting nutrients throughout the plant,
   maintaining cell turgidity (firmness), and facilitating various physiological
   processes. A lack of water can cause wilting, leaf drop and ultimately,
   death. Excessive water can also be detrimental, leading to root rot and other
   issues.

 * Soil quality: Soil provides structural support for plants and serves as a
   reservoir for essential nutrients and water. The composition of soil,
   including its pH level, mineral content, and organic matter, influences plant
   growth and health. Poor soil quality can limit nutrient availability, water
   retention and overall plant vigour.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why do plants live or die?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.
This experiment needs to be carried out over several days. The initial set up
and writing of a hypothesis will need approximately 40 minutes. Once the seeds
start to sprout, allow students some time each day to record their observations.
There should be enough evidence after eight days for the students to draw their
conclusions. This part of the task will require approximately 20 minutes.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how changing physical conditions in the environment affect
the growth and survival of plants.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
This activity encourages observation skills, critical thinking and scientific
inquiry as students view the video, Plant Detective, to analyse plant health and
consider the factors that might be affecting growth.

It may be beneficial for students to watch the video more than once—the first
time for enjoyment and then multiple times after to concentrate on each plant
case.

Part 2 of 3

Students complete an incident report for each case they saw. The report includes
a description of what happened and a hypothesis explaining why they think it
happened.

Part 3 of 3

Finally, students reflect on and consolidate their understanding of what
happened to each plant by completing the drag and drop Plant Detective Match
interactive. Connections to the real world are also made as students consider
when else plants may be affected by the conditions seen in the video:

 * No soil

 * Lack of water

 * Lack of sunlight

Example answers

No soil: Urban environments, hydroponic systems, rocky or sandy terrains, and
areas affected by erosion or deforestation can limit plant growth due to no or
little soil.

No water: In drought conditions, plants may wilt, become stunted, or die due to
insufficient moisture. Arid environments with naturally low water availability
limit plant diversity and growth. Over time, poor irrigation practices in
agriculture can lead to water stress, reducing crop yields and health.
Additionally, indoor plants or container gardens may experience water shortages
if not properly maintained, resulting in dehydration and poor growth.

No sun: In dense forests or shaded urban areas, limited sunlight can cause
plants to become leggy as they stretch towards light, leading to weak stems and
poor growth. Indoor plants may suffer if placed too far from windows or in rooms
with insufficient natural light, resulting in reduced photosynthesis and
chlorosis (yellowing of leaves). During prolonged cloudy weather or in regions
with minimal sunlight during certain seasons, plants may experience stunted
growth and reduced flowering or fruiting.
Setting the context for the investigation to come, this activity reinforces
understanding of the factors affecting plant growth—in particular, soil and
water quality. Using images depicting real-life situations, students describe
the plants in each image and discuss what might be influencing the soil quality.

Answers

Image 1: The plants look green and healthy. They are being sprayed by water
mixed with liquid fertiliser and organic material which can help plants grow
quickly.

Image 2: The tree is dead or dying as its soil has been flooded with salty sea
water.

Image 3: Toxic chemicals released from factories can cause polluted rain and air
which can seep into the soil and kill plants.
Addressing the cross-curriculum priority, 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Histories and Cultures', this activity introduces students to the concept of
cool burning, emphasising its ecological importance and the interconnectedness
of living things and their environment. Students watch a video and use the
research links to complete the concept map.

Answers

Who: First Nations Peoples have been managing the landscape for thousands of
years.

What: The burning of weeds and invasive grasses during the cooler months.

Where: In outback bush areas and forests.

Why: To get rid of weeds and promote healthy vegetation. ‘When you burn at the
right time, grass grows everywhere!’

How: Cool burning can help the land recover quickly, the land is cleaner and
animals have food to eat. Many native plant seeds are activated by fire and the
cool burning promotes this. Ash from cool burning can also be used as a natural
fertiliser to promote healthy native plants and trees to grow.
This activity encourages critical thinking, scientific reasoning and problem
solving as students analyse an image's plausibility and consider the challenges
and potential solutions for growing plants in a lunar environment.

Have students analyse the image and decide whether they believe it could be
real. Encourage them to provide at least three reasons to support their answer,
drawing on their knowledge of plant growth requirements and the conditions on
the moon.

Challenge students to brainstorm ideas for how plants could be grown on the
Moon, considering the challenges of lack of atmosphere, water and suitable soil.

Example answers

The image could not be real as plants are unable to grow on the Moon. This is
because the Moon lacks a breathable atmosphere, which means plants cannot rely
on natural air for carbon dioxide, which is necessary for photosynthesis. The
Moon experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from about 127°C
(260°F) during the day to -173°C (-280°F) at night.

Without a protective atmosphere, the Moon's surface is exposed to high levels of
solar and cosmic radiation, which can damage plant tissues. There is very little
liquid water on the Moon. Any water needed for plant growth would have to be
brought from Earth or extracted from lunar ice.

Lunar soil (regolith) lacks organic matter and the nutrients typically found in
Earth's soil, making it less suitable for plant growth without significant
modification.
This activity provides a hands-on investigation, allowing students to test a
hypothesis, collect data, and draw conclusions based on their observations of
the effects of different water types on plant growth.

Divide students into groups and provide each group with the necessary materials.

Part 2 of 3

Depending on the reading level of students, read the procedure together or allow
students to read in their groups.

Once students understand what they need to do, guide them to write a hypothesis.
Explain that a hypothesis is a clear, specific and testable statement predicting
the outcome of an experiment. Model writing an hypothesis using the 'If ... then
...' format. For example, 'If plants are watered with different types of water
(plain, acidic, salty, and organic), then the plants watered with plain water
will show the most growth, while those watered with salty water will show the
least growth.'

Part 3 of 3

Assist students in setting up their investigation and labelling their bags
accordingly. Over the next 5-8 days, have students observe and document the
growth of the seeds in each bag, using drawings or photographs. Once the
investigation concludes, guide students in analysing their data, drawing
conclusions about the effect of different water types, and discussing any
unexpected findings.

Example answer

Yes, water type does affect the growth of plants. Water source strongly
influences soil pH and mineral content, so plants can be affected by acidity or
alkalinity of the water source. Too much salt or acidic material can stop a
plant's growth.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
This activity expands students' understanding of plant life beyond terrestrial
environments, introducing them to a unique underwater ecosystem and encouraging
them to analyse and interpret information from the multimedia source, The Dead
Sea. Students learn about Tasmania's underwater forest and then use the
Unveiling Stories thinking routine to organise what they saw, heard and read.

The purpose of the Unveiling Stories thinking routine is to help students go
beyond surface-level observations and explore the deeper narratives, contexts
and perspectives that might not be immediately apparent. This approach
encourages students to think critically and empathetically, promoting a more
nuanced understanding of the subject matter.

Example answers

What's the plant story? The underwater forest of sea kelp has disappeared. Due
to the rise in water temperature, invasive sea life like sea urchins have
increased and have eaten and killed the kelp forest.

What's the world's story? Climate change can cause sea temperatures to rise,
which can cause many problems for Earth’s environments and ecosystems, on both
land and underwater.

What's the human story? Mike Baron, a dive instructor and biologist, has seen
the forest disappear and he is disturbed that his children and grandchildren
cannot experience what he used to see and do: to be able to dive and fish in the
giant underwater kelp forest.

understanding of the factors affecting plant growth—in particular, soil and
water quality. Using images depicting real-life situations, students describe
the plants in each image and discuss what might be influencing the soil quality.

[Statement Box] Unlike animals, plants cannot move around to look for food and water. Plants
absorb water and nutrients from the soil through their roots. The type of water
seeping into the soil can determine whether a plant grows well or poorly, or if
it withers and dies.
