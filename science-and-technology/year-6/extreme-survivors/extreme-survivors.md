**Year:** Year 5,Year 6

**Lesson ID:** 658

**Lesson name:** Extreme Survivors

**Lesson duration:** 120 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What are the toughest animals on Earth?

**Focus question image:**

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this first lesson, students will learn about living organisms that survive in extreme environments. They will be introduced to the toughest animal on Earth, the tiny tardigrade and explore how other living things survive the extreme conditions of the harshest environments on Earth.  Students will observe, research and develop scientific explanations about extreme environments and their inhabitants. They will present their findings using a digital program.  Scientific skills utilised in this lesson include observing, inferring, explaining, and applying knowledge.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Have students study the picture and read the focus question, 'What are the
toughest animals on Earth?' Discuss if they think the lion is the toughest
animal on Earth and why they think that. If they think lions are not the
toughest animals on Earth, ask them what animal they think is the toughest and
why.

Facilitate a discussion around their criteria for judging an animal as tough.
How many of them consider the ability to survive in a harsh environment as a
criteria for toughness? Have students consider how the environment an animal
lives in affects its survival. Document and use the students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Investigate and understand how physical conditions of the environment affect
- the survival of all living things.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify and describe the physical conditions of an extreme environment.
- Explain how at least two organisms have adapted to survive in their chosen
- environment.
- Create an infographic that includes key information about the environment,
- its conditions and the organisms that live there.

**TEACHER READING:**
Extreme environments are diverse and found across the globe, from the scorching
deserts of Africa to the frigid depths of the ocean. These environments present
unique challenges to life, often pushing the boundaries of what we consider
habitable.

Examples include:

 * Hydrothermal vents: Located on the ocean floor, these vents release
   superheated water rich in minerals, supporting unique ecosystems despite the
   absence of sunlight.

 * Hypersaline lakes: With salt concentrations far exceeding that of seawater,
   these lakes challenge organisms with osmotic stress and limited biodiversity.

 * Acidic hot springs: Characterised by high temperatures and low pH levels,
   these environments are home to organisms adapted to thrive in conditions that
   would be corrosive to most life.

Extremophiles are organisms that thrive in environments considered extreme by
human standards. These environments are characterised by conditions that would
be lethal to most life forms, such as extreme temperatures, high or low pH
levels, high salinity, intense pressure or lack of oxygen. 

Extremophiles have evolved unique adaptations that allow them to not only
survive, but also flourish in these harsh conditions. Their resilience and
unique biological mechanisms make them fascinating subjects of scientific study.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What are the toughest animals on Earth?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of how physical conditions of the environment affect the survival
of all living things.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students view the video Extremophiles. They then use evidence from the video to
complete the statements about their characteristics and scientific significance.

Answers

An extremophile can survive intense cold, extreme heat, high acidity and even
radioactivity. Extremophiles survive and thrive in extreme conditions.

Scientists study extremophiles to help solve the Earth’s problems like
developing medications, producing new types of fuel, protecting people against
radiation and even providing scientists with clues about life existing beyond
our planet.
This activity encourages independent research, information synthesis and
creative presentation skills as students research a specific extreme environment
and its inhabitants.

Students are provided with guided research resources for deserts, deep oceans
and mountains. Alternatively, allow students to choose other extreme
environments based on their interests.

Part 2 of 2

Students create an infographic using a digital program like Canva or Google
Slides, presenting information about their chosen environment in a visually
engaging way. Encourage students to include details about the environment's
physical conditions, at least two organisms and their adaptations, and examples
of other organisms found in that environment.

A checklist is provided to support students with self-assessing their work.

Example answers

Amazon tropical rainforest

Physical conditions: A tropical rainforest experiences warm temperatures, high
humidity, plenty of sunlight and a high quantity of rain.

Living things: Up to half of all living things on Earth could be living in
tropical rainforests. Plants receive plenty of rain to grow. Living things can
be found in all layers of the rainforest. Animals living in rainforests include
electric eels and orangutangs.

Arctic ice cap

Physical conditions: Many areas in the polar ice caps are covered in ice all
year so there is no snow. They are dry deserts, as very little rain falls there.
Temperatures can fall to -80 degrees. There is little sunlight with the Sun only
shining for six months of the year.

Living things: Only a few living things can survive life there all year round.
They include the polar bear and harp seals. Not many plants survive as there is
very little soil to grow.
This activity is designed to stimulate interest and curiosity in the lesson, and
begins to address a common misconception students might have that only large or
visually imposing creatures are tough. Have students view the stimulus images
carefully and facilitate a discussion about which of the two creatures they
think is the toughest and why.
This activity encourages creative thinking and application of knowledge as
students design a unique environment and consider the adaptations necessary for
survival in those conditions.

Encourage students to describe their chosen environment in detail, including its
conditions, potential energy sources, extreme temperatures, unusual atmospheric
composition, or unique geological features and any other relevant factors.

Students then design and describe organisms that could survive in their imagined
environment, explaining the adaptations that allow them to thrive.
This activity connects to the lesson's focus question, 'What are the toughest
animals on Earth?' as students are presented with six animals considered to be
among the toughest. They research two of the animals to find out the physical
adaptations that make them tough and resilient, their unique behaviours or
survival strategies, and any real-life examples or stories that demonstrate
their toughness.

Part 2 of 2

To complete the activity, the students choose which of their two chosen animals
they think is the toughest and write a justification of their choice.

Information about why each animal is considered tough:

Cockroach:

 * Known for their resilience, able to survive without food for a month,
   withstand radiation and endure severe physical trauma.

Wolverine:

 * Known for their strength and ferocity, capable of surviving in harsh, cold
   environments and taking down prey much larger than themselves.

Naked mole-rat:

 * Thrive in underground burrows in East Africa, resistant to cancer, capable of
   surviving low-oxygen environments and exhibiting social structures similar to
   ants.

Dung Beetle:

 * Survive on a diet of faeces, capable of rolling large balls of dung across
   long distances and thriving in various harsh environments.

Lungfish:

 * Capable of surviving in dry conditions by burrowing into mud and entering a
   state of estivation, reducing their metabolic rate until water returns.

Tardigrades:

 * Known for their ability to survive extreme temperatures, radiation,
   dehydration and even the vacuum of space.

PART 1:
[Statement Box] As far as we know, planet Earth is the only place in our Solar System where life
exists. Every surface of our planet is occupied by some form of life. Most
organisms live in habitats where the conditions are mild and just right for
survival. However, some habitats have such extreme environmental conditions that
it's hard to imagine anything being able to survive. Amazingly, some organisms
such as extremophiles have evolved to thrive in these places.
