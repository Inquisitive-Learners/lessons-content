**Year:** Year 5,Year 6

**Lesson ID:** 659

**Lesson name:** Will We Stay or Will We Go?

**Lesson duration:** 120 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What do animals do when the seasons change?

**Focus question image:**
Wildebeests leaping into a river, surrounded by dust and splashing water.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will learn about migration and hibernation, and consider the effects of physical conditions which cause animals to behave this way. They will use a flow chart organiser to map the migratory journey of one species of animal and after conducting a brief investigation, will research the reasons why and how some animals are able to survive harsh seasonal environments. Students will understand that there is a pattern of natural change in the seasons that affect all living things and work collaboratively to analyse the causes of migration and hibernation.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Students view the image and discuss what they see happening and why they think
it is happening. Read the focus question, 'What do animals do when the seasons
change?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Describe how living things adapt and manage changes to the physical
- conditions in their environment in order to survive.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify examples of animals that migrate or hibernate.
- Explain why animals migrate or hibernate when seasons change.
- Describe how seasonal changes affect physical conditions like temperature and
- food availability.
- Explain how these changes influence animal behaviour and survival.

**TEACHER READING:**
Animal migration: Animal migration is the seasonal movement of animals from one
region to another, often over long distances. This cyclical behaviour is driven
by the need to find optimal conditions for survival and reproduction, such as
abundant food sources, suitable breeding grounds and favourable climates. Many
species of birds, mammals, fish and insects undertake migrations, showcasing
remarkable navigational abilities and resilience.

Hibernation: Hibernation is a state of dormancy that some animals enter during
periods of unfavourable conditions, typically winter. This state is
characterised by a significant decrease in metabolic rate, body temperature,
heart rate and breathing rate, allowing animals to conserve energy and survive
when food is scarce and temperatures are low. Hibernation involves complex
physiological and behavioural adaptations, ensuring the animal's survival until
environmental conditions improve.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What do animals do when the seasons change?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to describe how living things adapt and manage changes to the physical
conditions in their environment in order to survive.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
To begin this activity, students view a video showing global animal movements.
To stimulate interest and curiosity, do not tell students what the video is
about prior to watching. It is recommended that students watch the video more
than once—the first time for enjoyment, and the second time to discuss what they
saw in the video and what they think the video is about.

Part 2 of 2

Once students have completed their initial discussion, move to the second page
where the students are told the pink lines represent animals. Watch the video
again and discuss what they think the animals are doing and what animals they
might be.
This activity promotes research skills, information synthesis and geographical
representation as students delve deeper into a specific example of animal
migration.

Depending on student ability, read the eBook Seasons of Change as a class, in
pairs or independently. The eBook has been created to explicitly teach students
about migration. This, along with the provided website, will be used by students
to complete the task of representing an animal's migration journey.

Part 2 of 3

Choosing from a humpback whale, arctic tern or wildebeest, students use the
provided research link, books and trusted websites to research its migration
journey.

Part 3 of 3

Students then describe and label the animal’s migration journey including
information such as: time of year and distances, reasons for migration, and
physical conditions in different locations.

A graphic organiser is provided for this task or students may wish to complete
it digitally.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
This activity introduces hibernation to the students. To provoke curiosity, they
observe an image of an animal sleeping curled up in a nest and then discuss
their thoughts about what sort of animal it is and why it might be sleeping in
that position.

Part 2 of 2

Students now learn the animal is a dormouse, the longest hibernator on Earth.
The purpose of hibernation is explicitly taught with students having an
opportunity to consolidate their understanding through the completion of a
simple hands-on investigation.

Students read the steps of the investigation before making a prediction. It is
suggested the class undertake the investigation at the same time, with the
teacher displaying a two-minute timer on the interactive whiteboard. Students
should be encouraged to record their observations using as much detail as
possible.

The activity finishes with students connecting what happened during the
investigation with the dormouse's behaviour.

In this activity, students use their understanding of hibernation to decide if
the statement, 'During hibernation, animals do not eat or drink.' is fact or
fake.

Answer

During hibernation, animals typically do not eat or drink. Hibernation is a
state of significantly reduced metabolic activity where the animal's
physiological processes slow down to conserve energy.

Part 2 of 2

Then using the provided websites, students discover more about animals that
hibernate to survive harsh environments all year round. They create their own
fact or fake statements to test a friend about hibernation.
Applying what they have learnt throughout the lesson, students now work with a
partner to think of six different reasons why animals migrate or hibernate. They
apply their critical-thinking skills as they rank their reasons in order of
importance. Provide an opportunity for students to justify their ranking with
each other, noticing similarities and differences in opinion.
This critical-thinking activity requires students to consider the merits of
using digital devices to track animals from the perspective of scientists,
animals and Earth.

Example answers

From the perspective of a scientist: I can gather a lot of information about
animal behaviours, movements and habitats. This data helps me understand how
animals live and what they need to survive. By knowing where animals go and what
areas are important to them, I can create better plans to protect these animals
and their environments. I can also see how animals respond to changes in their
environment, like climate change or new buildings. This helps predict future
impacts and find ways to help animals adapt.

From the perspective of an animal: Tracking can help keep me safe from threats
like poaching. If I become unwell, my health can be monitored and I can receive
help to get better quickly.

From the perspective of Earth: Tracking helps preserve different species, which
is important for maintaining my balanced ecosystem. Healthy ecosystems provide
clean air, water and fertile soils. Understanding animal movements and
behaviours can also protect me from the impact of climate change. Information
from tracking can guide where to build cities, roads and other structures so
they have less impact on wildlife. This helps humans and animals coexist on me
peacefully.
This creativethinking activity requires students to carefully observe an unusual
image of a snapping turtle. Snapping turtles typically hibernate by burying
themselves in muddy bogs or lowland wet areas where they remain for the winter
months. Subsequently, this snapping turtle has emerged from hibernation with a
mound of soil and grass growing on its back.

Students first consider why the image went viral, before using what they have
learnt about hibernation to explain how it has come to look like this. They then
create another reason for how it came to be, in the form of a myth or legend.
