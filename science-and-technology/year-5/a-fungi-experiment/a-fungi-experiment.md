**Year:** Year 5,Year 6

**Lesson ID:** 731

**Lesson name:** A Fungi Experiment

**Lesson duration:** 120 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Is your bread alive?

**Focus question image:**
An assortment of various bread types and flour on a textured surface.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will investigate how physical conditions of the environment affect the growth and survival of living things by planning and conducting a scientific experiment into the growth of mould. Students will represent and describe their observations and collect, present and analyse their data as evidence in developing explanations.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Have students view the image and ask, 'Is your bread alive?' Facilitate a
discussion around why someone would think their bread is alive. Introduce mould
by asking students to consider what happens to bread when it gets old. Have they
ever seen something growing on old bread? Document and use the studentsâ€™
responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify
any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Make a hypothesis, follow an experimental procedure, record results and form
- a conclusion based on evidence gathered.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Make a clear hypothesis.
- Follow the steps of an experiment safely and correctly.
- Observe and accurately record results over time.
- Use evidence from their results to draw a conclusion.
- Explain whether their hypothesis was correct and why.

**TEACHER READING:**
Moulds are fungi that grow in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae.
They thrive in warm, damp and humid conditions, and can be found on various
surfaces, including food like bread.

In order to survive, mould needs a source of water. High humidity, leaks or
condensation can create suitable conditions. Mould typically grows best in warm
environments, but some species can tolerate cold temperatures. Mould feeds on
organic materials including bread, wood and paper.

Bread provides an ideal environment due to its nutrients.

Mould reproduces via spores, which can be airborne and settle on surfaces to
grow new mould colonies.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Is your bread alive?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson
The initial set up and writing of the aim and hypothesis will need approximately
40 minutes.

Provide an opportunity at approximately the same time every day for students to
observe their bread and record their observations. The experiment should run for
approximately five days, with students being given time to complete their
conclusion and evaluation. This part of the task will require approximately 20
minutes.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to make a hypothesis, follow an experimental procedure, record results
and form a conclusion based on evidence gathered.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
To stimulate interest and curiosity in the lesson, students view the video
showing a microscopic look at mould growing. At this point do not share any
information about what the video is about, instead accept all reasonable answers
from students as they describe what they think the video is about.
Students are now told that the video shows mould under a microscope and a
definition of mould is given. Through the use of the visible thinking activity,
Think, Pair, Share, students are encouraged to explore and discuss their
understanding of mould. They consider other substances or organisms that
resemble mould, as well as various environments where mould can and might grow.

Example answers

Other living things that look like mould: lichens, moss, algae, slime moulds,
yeast, bacteria.

Places where mould might grow: Bathrooms - On shower curtains, tiles, grout, and
around sinks.

Kitchens - Inside refrigerators, on old food, under sinks, and in rubbish bins.

Laundry - In washing machines (especially front-loading ones) and around laundry
sinks.

Windows - On window sills and frames, especially if there is condensation.

Air conditioning units - Inside the units and on filters.

Carpets and upholstery -Especially if they have been exposed to moisture.

Books and papers - In damp, humid environments.

Plants - On soil and leaves, especially if over-watered.
Setting the context for the experiment, students learn that mould grows in
suitable conditions. They then carry out an experiment to find out the best
conditions for growing mould.

Divide students into groups and provide each group with the necessary materials.

Part 2 of 6

Depending on the reading level of students, read the procedure together or allow
students to read in their groups.

Once students understand what they need to do, guide them to write an aim. A
suitable aim for this experiment is, 'We want to find out the best conditions
for growing mould.'

Part 3 of 6

Next, students write a hypothesis. Explain that a hypothesis is a clear,
specific and testable statement predicting the outcome of an experiment. Model
writing an hypothesis using the 'If ... then ...' format. A suitable hypothesis
for this experiment is, 'If slices of bread are placed in different physical
conditions, then the bread placed in warm, moist and dark conditions will
develop mould the fastest, while the bread in cold, dry and light conditions
will develop mould the slowest.'

Once students have written their hypothesis, have them consider what they need
to do to undertake a fair test.

Example answer

Keeping the same: type and size of bread, initial condition of bread, handling
method, type of plastic bag, sealing method, observation schedule, environment
monitoring, placement date and time.

Deliberately changing: the conditions (temperature, moisture, light exposure).

Observing or measuring: presence and extent of mould, mould type and rate of
growth.

Part 5 of 6

Students complete the experiment over approximately five days, ensuring they
study each slice of bread every day, ideally around the same time. Provide
students time to record their observations daily.

Part 6 of 6

Once the experiment concludes, guide students in analysing their data, drawing
conclusions about the type of physical conditions that mould thrives in, and how
knowing this information can help them keep their food mould free.

Finally, students self-assess what worked well and what they would do
differently if they completed the experiment again.
This activity takes the learning further as students watch a virtual experiment
designed to prove that yeast is a living organism.

In the video, students observe yeast being added to sugar water. When this
happens, the yeast consumes sugar and produces carbon dioxide. The production of
carbon dioxide gas inflates the balloon, demonstrating that yeast is
metabolically active, producing gas as a byproduct. The yeast shows key
characteristics of life, such as metabolism and gas exchange, proving that it is
a living organism.

Part 2 of 2

Students explain what they think happened in the experiment and reason about
what the investigation proves.
In this creative-thinking activity, students learn about penicillin. They begin
by viewing three images and consider how they might be connected. The first
image depicts bacteria, the second image shows bacteria unwell/dying, and the
third image is of the Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming, who
accidentally discovered penicillin in 1928. Students write a story of how they
think they are connected.

Part 2 of 2

The second part of the activity involves students exploring a website about
penicillin. They then draw or write about the connection.

PART 2:
[Instruction Box] Procedure

 1. Use the clean tongs to place each slice of bread in a clear plastic bag (if
    you use your fingers you may transfer bacteria or mould spores from your
    fingers onto the bread).

 2. As a group, decide on the locations you will place each bag. To compare and
    gather your evidence, each slice of bread must be exposed to different
    physical conditions.

 3. Label each bag, describing the physical conditions of where it will be
    placed.

 4. Take a photo of each bag before placing them in their assigned locations.

 5. Study each slice of bread every day, around the same time. Record what you
    observe in the results table.
[Plain Text] Before you begin the experiment, write an aim. The aim is a statement that
describes the purpose for doing the experiment.
[Coloured Box] Examples of locations for the bread:

 * Dry and dark (in a cupboard)

 * Wet and warm (soak the bread in water and place in sunlight)

 * Cold and dry (in a fridge)

 * Hot (on a window sill, in direct sunlight)
