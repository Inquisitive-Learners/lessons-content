**Lesson ID:** 660

**Lesson name:** Microlife

**Lesson duration:** 90 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What is the best habitat for microorganisms?

**Focus question image:**
A gloved hand holds a petri dish with various colourful bacterial colonies.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students describe and predict the effect of environmental changes and physical conditions on microbes (microorganisms). Exploring the presence of bacteria all around us, on our bodies, in our homes and in most environments on Earth, students will discover that all living things, including microbes, require particular conditions to survive and thrive.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and discuss what they see and what they think it might
be. Then ask,

'What is the best habitat for microorganisms?' If needed, explain that a
microorganism is an organism that can be seen only through a microscope. Use the
students’ responses to the focus question to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of bacteria and the physical conditions that
- affect its survival.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Describe what bacteria are and where they can live.
- Identify places in their home where bacteria might grow and explain why.
- Explain what physical conditions help bacteria survive.
- Suggest ways to reduce bacteria growth in everyday places.

**TEACHER READING:**
Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that are found everywhere on Earth,
including in soil, water and inside our bodies. They belong to the domain
Bacteria, one of the three domains of life, along with Archaea and Eukarya.

Bacteria are very small—typically ranging from 0.2 to 2 micrometres in size.
They have a simple cell structure without a nucleus. Their genetic material is
found in a single circular DNA strand. Bacteria come in various shapes,
including spheres (cocci), rods (bacilli), spirals (spirilla), and commas
(vibrios). Bacteria reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission,
where one cell divides into two identical cells.

Bacteria can live in a wide range of environments from extreme heat and cold to
the human gut and ocean depths. Many bacteria are beneficial. For example, those
in our digestive system help us break down food and absorb nutrients. Bacteria
are used in food production (e.g. yogurt and cheese) and in biotechnology (e.g.
producing insulin). Some bacteria can cause diseases, such as Streptococcus
(strep throat), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), and Salmonella (food
poisoning). Antibiotics are medicines used to treat bacterial infections.
However, misuse and overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance, where bacteria
evolve to resist the effects of these drugs.

Bacteria play a critical role in ecosystems. They help decompose organic matter,
recycle nutrients and even fix nitrogen in the soil, which is essential for
plant growth. Bacteria need certain conditions to grow, including moisture,
nutrients,and appropriate temperatures. They can multiply rapidly under ideal
conditions.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What is the best habitat for microorganisms?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of bacteria and the physical conditions that affect its survival.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
To provoke engagement and curiosity in the lesson, students observe the photo of
a bathroom where fluorescent dye has been used to make the bacteria visible to
the naked eye. Fluorescent dyes are specially designed to bind to bacteria or
other microorganisms and emit a visible light when exposed to a particular
wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light. Do not share this information yet with the
students. Instead, ask them to consider what the coloured areas are showing.
Connecting the learning to the students everyday lives, they now apply their
reasoning skills to rank four common household items from having the most to the
least amount of bacteria.

Once students have used the interactive to make their predictions, they explore
the website A Home for Bacteria to check if they were correct.

Part 2 of 2

They then record the results, reflecting on what surprised them and sharing why
they think the toothbrushes and holder contain the most bacteria.

Answers

Toothbrush holder - 330 000 bacteria per square metre

Washing machine - 300 000 bacteria per square metre

Mobile phone - 3000 bacteria per square metre

Toilet seat - 325 bacteria per square metre
Students are now told that the coloured areas in the bathroom were showing where
all the bacteria live. Read and discuss the information about bacteria before
students explore the website, Bacteria in the Cafeteria.

The Bacteria in the Cafeteria game on the American Museum of Natural History
website is an educational activity designed to teach children about bacteria. In
the game, players solve a riddle by learning about the different types of
bacteria, where they can be found and their roles in our environment. The game
emphasises that while some bacteria can cause illness, many are harmless or even
beneficial to humans.

Part 2 of 2

Once students have explored the website, they apply the information they have
learnt to draw and describe four different places where bacteria can grow and
survive. They then apply their critical-thinking skills to consider how these
places are the same and how they are different.

Answers

Four places in the game where bacteria could grow and survive:

 * Kitchen counters

 * Cutting boards

 * Refrigerator handles

 * Sink drains

What's the same about these places?

 * High-usage areas: All these places are frequently used in food preparation
   and storage, making them prone to bacterial contamination.

 * Moisture presence: They often have moisture, which is essential for bacterial
   growth.

 * Food contact: These surfaces come into contact with food, providing nutrients
   that bacteria need to thrive.

 * Need for cleaning: Regular and thorough cleaning is necessary to prevent
   bacterial buildup.

What's different?

 * Surface type: Kitchen counters and cutting boards are solid surfaces directly
   used for food prep. Refrigerator handles and sink drains are touched
   frequently but not used for food prep, while drains deal with wastewater.

 * Bacterial exposure: Cutting boards are high risk due to direct contact with
   raw food,
   
   while refrigerator handles have mainly indirect contact, from hands.

 * Cleaning methods: Kitchen counters are wiped down frequently, while sink
   drains often require deep cleaning or specific products to remove buildup.

Taking the learning further, students now have another opportunity to explore
Bacteria in the Cafeteria again with the aim of finding facts that could be used
to support two different opinions about bacteria: bacteria are heroes and
bacteria are villains. If possible, provide students with books and trusted
websites to support their research.

Example answers

Hero - Bacteria in our gut are essential for digestion. They help break down the
food we eat and absorb nutrients. Some bacteria in our gut and on our skin
protect us by fighting off harmful germs.

Bacteria play a role in recycling nutrients in the environment. In the soil,
bacteria break down dead plants and animals, turning them into nutrients that
new plants can use to grow.

Some bacteria clean up pollution. They can break down oil spills and other toxic
chemicals.

Some bacteria like Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, live in water.
They perform photosynthesis, just like plants and produce oxygen, which makes it
possible for life to exist on Earth.

Bacteria are also used to make many of the foods and medicines we rely on. For
example, yogurt, cheese and sauerkraut are made using beneficial bacteria. In
medicine, bacteria are used to produce antibiotics and other important drugs
that save lives.

Villain - One of the most obvious ways bacteria are villains is by causing
diseases. Harmful bacteria, like Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, can cause
infections that make us very sick. Diseases like strep throat, pneumonia and
tuberculosis are all caused by bacteria. These illnesses can be severe and
sometimes even life-threatening.

Bacteria are a major cause of food poisoning, which can make people very ill.
Bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli can contaminate food and cause symptoms
like stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. Food poisoning can be especially
dangerous for young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune
systems.

Bacteria have the ability to become resistant to antibiotics, the medicines we
use to treat bacterial infections. This resistance makes it harder to cure
infections and can lead to 'superbugs' that are very difficult to treat. The
rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious public health threat.

Some bacteria can form biofilms, which are slimy layers that stick to surfaces.
These biofilms can grow on medical devices like catheters and implants, making
infections harder to treat. Biofilms also form on teeth as plaque, leading to
cavities and gum disease if not properly cleaned.

Some bacteria, like certain types of Cyanobacteria, can cause harmful algal
blooms in water bodies. These blooms produce toxins that can kill fish, harm
aquatic ecosystems, and make water unsafe for drinking and recreation. These
blooms can also release toxins into the air, posing health risks to humans and
animals.
This activity requires students to critically consider a real-world problem as
they explore the connection between antibiotic use and the spread of superbugs.

Part 2 of 2

They complete the task by creating their own creative solution for stopping the
spread of superbugs.

Example answers

Agree - To stop the spread of superbugs, we should avoid taking antibiotics for
bacterial infections unless absolutely necessary. Overusing antibiotics can lead
to antibiotic resistance, making bacteria stronger and harder to kill. By not
taking antibiotics, we let our immune system do its job, reduce side effects,
protect good bacteria, and encourage better medical practices. This helps keep
superbugs from spreading and becoming more dangerous.

Disagree - We should not stop taking antibiotics for bacterial infections
because they are crucial for treating serious illnesses and preventing
complications. If we don’t use antibiotics when needed, infections can worsen
and spread to others. Responsible use of antibiotics, like taking the full
prescribed course and not using them for viral infections, can help prevent
antibiotic resistance without compromising our health.
Students now complete the 3, 2, 1 visible thinking activity to show what they
have learnt about bacteria.
