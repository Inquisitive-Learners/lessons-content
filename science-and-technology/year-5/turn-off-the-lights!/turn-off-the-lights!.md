**Year:** Year 5,Year 6

**Lesson ID:** 4962

**Lesson name:** Turn off the Lights! 

**Lesson duration:** 30 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How can switching off a light

help a turtle?

**Focus question image:**

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will investigate how switching off or reducing artificial lights can help living things survive. Students are introduced to light pollution through exploring its impact on the survival of baby turtles. They then research how light pollution affects other animals and what they can do to minimise these effects.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and ask the focus question, 'How can switching off a
light help a turtle?'

Do not lead the discussion too much. Simply ask students to think of what the
connection between electric lights and turtles might be and acknowledge any
valid suggestions as possibilities.

Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Explain how light pollution affects animals and give solutions to how we can
- reduce this effect.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand what light pollution is.
- Describe how light pollution impacts turtles and what we can do to reduce
- this impact.
- Research other animals affected by light pollution and possible solutions.
- Create a poster outlining the impact of light pollution on animals and
- encouraging people to implement solutions.

**TEACHER READING:**
Many human activities change the physical conditions of animal habitats, often
in a damaging way that makes animal survival difficult. Light pollution is one
such example. Other examples explored later in the lesson include plastic waste
pollution, land clearing and noise pollution in the marine environment.

Light pollution is the presence of excessive artificial light that brightens the
night sky. It has grown steadily since the adoption of electric street lighting
in the early 1900s, and increased significantly in the last two decades thanks
to a rapid increase in urbanisation and population growth. (Citizen science data
collected between 2011 and 2022 and analysed by university researchers showed
that, across the globe, the night sky's brightness has been increasing by over
9% per year.)

Some students may be aware that the number of stars they can see in the night
sky increases dramatically when they are away from city lights and in a darker,
more remote area. This is because the brightness of the artificial city lights
'drowns out' the light of the stars.

Light pollution disrupts the natural behaviours of many species by confusing
their natural rhythms and navigation systems. In Australia, these species
include seabirds, migratory birds, bats and nocturnal mammals such as possums,
quolls and bilbies. The focus of this lesson is sea turtles.

Australian beaches are used by 6 out of 7 of the world's species of sea turtles
as nesting sites. Turtle nesting locations stretch around the northern coast,
from the Gold Coast in South East Queensland, to Exmouth in Western Australia.
Mon Repos beach in Bundaberg supports the largest population of nesting
loggerhead turtles in the South Pacific ocean.

Female turtles move up onto a beach and dig a hole in the sand in which they lay
around 100 eggs. They cover them with sand and then move back into the ocean,
never meeting their young. Newly hatched sea turtles rely on moonlight and
starlight reflecting on the water’s surface to guide them to the ocean. Bright
urban and residential lighting near beaches can cause them to move away from the
sea and towards the dangers presented by predators (including pets), traffic and
dehydration.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How can switching off a light help a turtle?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.
In the Night Lights video, students may be surprised to see many points of light
across the interior of Western Australia, a largely uninhabited section of the
country. The lights are attributable to outback mining activities and gas
flaring (the controlled burning off of excess natural gas) and bushfires. The
bright and extensive lights are also an artefact of how images like these are
created. A lot of data is collected over several days and many orbits by a
satellite, with the data then being composited into a single image.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to explain how light pollution affects animals and what we can do to
reduce this.

**LESSON OUTCOMES:**

Australian National Curriculum:
1. AC9S6U01(ACARA V9.0) (investigate the physical conditions of a habitat and analyse how the growth and survival of living things is affected by changing physical conditions)
NSW Syllabus:
1. ST3-4LW-S (examines how the environment affects the growth, survival and adaptation of living things)
Victorian Curriculum:
1. VC2S6U01 (habitats can be described by their physical conditions; changing the physical conditions of a habitat, including by human activity, may affect the growth and survival of organisms)

**DETAILED ACTIVITIES:**

**ACTIVITY 1:**
Description: Show students the video Night Lights. This is a short montage showing how
artificial lighting brightens the night sky, from a global level to a city
level, with some focus at the end on how we light up beaches and coastlines.

Duration: 15 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Direct student attention to the night-time map of Australia. Read the purple box
and ask:

 * What does it tell us about where most people live?

Students should conclude that most people live on the coast of Australia, or
more specifically the East coast.

Note that all of the capital cities can be identified, as well as large regional
cities. Point out that some of the lights in sparsely populated inland Australia
can be attributed to mining or bushfire activity.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Look at the map of Australia at night.

**ACTIVITY 3:**
Description: Have students read the purple box about how newly hatched turtles (called
hatchlings) use reflected moonlight and starlight to find their way to the
ocean.

Ask students to use the dimmer on the animation to see how artificial lighting
near the beach can affect a baby turtle's journey to the ocean. Ask them to talk
to a classmate about what they observe, and possible reasons for it.
[Plain Text] Use the dimmer on the animation to observe how changing the lighting near the
beach affects the turtles' journey to the ocean. Chat with a classmate about
what you see.
[Statement Box] When baby turtles hatch, they make their way to the ocean.

They use the reflected light of the moon and stars on the water to help them
move in the right direction.

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: Read the purple box to or with students to consolidate their understanding from
the animation in Activity 3—that artificial lighting near beaches disorientates
baby turtles and leads them away from the ocean and into danger.

Introduce the term 'light pollution'. Note that it is different to what students
might think of as pollution, but it is something that has been introduced to the
natural environment and created problems.

Introduce the dilemma: Humans need light to see in the dark, but this light can
be dangerous for baby turtles.

Ask them to Think, Pair, Share ideas on what could be done to solve this
problem.
PART 1:
[Statement Box] Bright street lights and house lights near beaches confuse turtle hatchlings.
Instead of moving towards the moonlight and the water, they move towards these
artificial lights, which brings them into the dangers of traffic, pets and sea
birds. They also risk dehydration from being out of the water for too long.  

When too much artificial light brightens the sky, it is called light pollution.
[Coloured Box] Humans need light to see in the dark, but this light can be dangerous for baby
turtles!

[Discussion] What can we do to solve this problem?
[Plain Text] Think, Pair, Share some ideas. On the next page, create a class list of things
you think humans could do to help. 

PART 2:
[Plain Text] Explore the website, including the 'How you can help' section.

**ACTIVITY 5:**
Description: Students undertake a Jigsaw Strategy research task in a group of four. Each
student in the group chooses a different animal from the four listed in the
jigsaw image (mammals, shorebirds, bats, sea birds). They move out of their
jigsaw group and find the other classmates that have the same animal. Together
in this new group, they conduct some research on the problems that light
pollution causes for their animal, and actions that can be (or have been) taken
to help reduce or fix the problems.
PART 1:
[Plain Text]  * Form a group of four. This is your jigsaw group. 

 * Each group member should choose one of the animals affected by light
   pollution shown in the jigsaw.

 * Find the other class members that have the same animal as you. Together,
   explore the information for that animal on the website.

PART 3:
[Instruction Box]  * Return to your jigsaw group. Share your research on your animal with the rest
   of the group.
[Discussion] What problems or solutions come up repeatedly?
[Instruction Box]  * Use colours to highlight these points on your notes page.
[Instruction Box]  * Listen carefully as the other group members share theirs.

PART 4:
[Plain Text] Study the poster that was created to help protect turtles near Bundaberg,
Queensland. 
[Instruction Box] Using your research and a digital program such as Canva or Google Slides, create
your own poster that teaches people about the impact of light pollution on
Australian animals and what we can do to help. Use the checklist to help you.

**ACTIVITY 6:**
Description: This research activity extends students' understanding of human impact on animal
survival by considering other ways in which human activities change the physical
conditions of animal habitats and the consequences.

Three research options are provided: polluting water, land clearing and ocean
noise pollution.
PART 1:
[Plain Text] Many human activities change the environment that animals live in. This can make
it difficult for them to survive.

These activities include polluting water, clearing land or creating ocean noise
pollution.

**ACTIVITY 7:**
Description: This activity asks students to think critically and creatively about an issue,
generating arguments and ideas that consider different perspectives.

Ask students to consider the night-time light displays that are often held
during winter months. Some students may have been to one.

Introduce students to an Options Diamond visible thinking activity. Read through
the steps with the students and ensure that they understand the steps they
should follow
PART 1:
[Image] A tunnel adorned with glowing fairy lights at night.
[Plain Text] During the winter months, many towns and cities hold events with big night-time
displays of coloured lights.

People buy tickets to walk through these displays.
[Plain Text] Use the template on the next page to create an Options Diamond.

 * On one side of the diamond, write a reason for why these events should be
   banned.
   
   

 * On the other side of the diamond, write a reason for why these events should
   be allowed.
   
   

 * At the bottom, write a compromise. This is a way an event like this could be
   run, but with the least effect on animals.
   
   

 * At the top, write a whole new way that an event like this could be run
   without any effect on animals.
