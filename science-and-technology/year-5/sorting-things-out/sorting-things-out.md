**Year:** Year 5

**Lesson ID:** 654

**Lesson name:** Sorting Things Out

**Lesson duration:** 105 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How do we organise our things?

**Focus question image:**
A sink overflowing with dirty dishes, pots, and utensils in a cluttered kitchen.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
This Chemical Sciences (Material World) unit opens by considering properties and how they are used to classify matter. Students watch a video of an innovative new substance and describe its properties. They group some well-known items based on common properties.  They use an interactive to explore the specific properties of the three states of matter - solids, liquids and gases – and complete a practical exploration of compression. Scientific skills utilised in this lesson include describing, classifying, observing, inferring.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
To stimulate interest and curiosity about Chemical Sciences Material World,
students view the stimulus image and answer the following questions:

 * After washing the dishes, how do you organise them in the cupboards?

 * Can you think of some different ways you could organise them?

They turn and talk to a partner about them.

Usually in a kitchen objects are grouped by their function (what they do) –
glasses and cups in one spot, plates and bowls in another, saucepans, baking
tins, food containers and lids all grouped together. Discuss how else kitchen
items could be grouped, such as the material they are made from (e.g. plastic
items in one group, metal, glass, wood items all in their own groups). The items
could also be grouped by size, shape or colour.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Understand that properties are used to describe and classify matter.
- Use the properties of solids, liquids and gases to classify matter.

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

In the world of chemical science, when objects have a common property, it means
they share something similar or alike. This could be how they look, how they
behave, or what they're made of. For example, if we say that all fruits have a
common property of being colourful and tasty, it means they all share the
characteristic of having bright colours and being delicious to eat. Similarly,
in chemistry, objects like elements or compounds might have a common property,
such as being solid, liquid, or gas, or reacting in similar ways with other
substances. Understanding common properties helps scientists categorise and
understand different materials and how they interact with each other.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
Revisit the focus question:

 * How do we organise our things?

Ask students to share their ideas.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  

The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. In addition, the last
slide of the lesson displays the relevant words with definitions and images to
consolidate student understanding.
Answers + Background Science

Yes, a solid can be compressed, but usually only by a very small amount. For
example, if you press down on a solid object like a sponge or a piece of clay,
it will compress slightly.

No, a liquid cannot be compressed easily. Liquids are already incompressible,
meaning their molecules are packed closely together and cannot be squeezed
closer.

Yes, a gas can be compressed. Gases are made up of widely spaced molecules that
move freely. When you apply pressure to a gas, its volume decreases because the
molecules are forced closer together, allowing it to be compressed.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of classifying matter using its properties, such as solids,
liquids, and gases.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Watch the video Edible Water.

'Ooho' is an edible water bottle created out of 100% biodegradable brown algae
that is an environmentally-friendly alternative to plastic bottles.

Then go onto the next slide. Using information from the stimulus video: Edible
Water, students use the 5 x 2 visible thinking activity to describe the new
water bottle.

 1. Write 5 words in the circle to describe the new water bottle.

 2. Watch the video again.

 3. Write 5 additional words to describe the water bottle. This time use a
    different coloured pen.

Answers may include: soft, squishy, thin, small, light, round, tough,
transparent, sphere/circle, edible, biodegradable.
Explain to students that the words they wrote in the circle are the properties
of the new water bottle. What an object looks like, feels like, is made of and
how it behaves, are all properties of that object.

An image of a rubber duck floating on water is provided for students look at:

'I’m rubbery, light, plastic and coloured. I also float in water!'

Transition students into the next slide by asking the questions:

 * What other objects have the same properties as a rubber duck?

 * How many can you think of?

Reiterate that properties can be used to sort objects into groups. The members
of each group all have properties in common.

On slide two, there are two groups of objects. Students discuss with a partner
what property the members of each group have in common. They are given
vocabulary to help them describe the properties: metal, plastic, flexible,
rigid, inelastic, elastic, opaque, transparent, light, heavy.

Group 1: coins, aluminium foil, car parts, water tanks 

(All made from metal)

Group 2: pipe cleaners, Blu Tack, eraser, pool noodles

(All flexible - can be bent)
Explain to students that there are many different substances in the universe.
Another word for all these substances is matter. Scientists like to sort matter
by their properties. Matter is anything that has mass (you can weigh it) and
volume (it takes up space). There are three main states (groups) of matter:
solids, liquids and gases. All of the substances in each group have properties
in common.

Hands-On Investigation

One property that we use to sort matter is whether it can be compressed or not.
We compress a substance when we make it smaller by force. Students follow the
steps below to find out which states of matter can be compressed.

Collect the materials listed on the first slide.

Go onto the next slide and continue to follow the instructions.

Step 1: Remove the plunger from the syringe and fill it almost full of sand (a
solid). Place a finger over the hole at the end to stop the sand from coming
out.

Step 2: Replace the plunger and move it down the barrel so it is touching the
sand.

Step 3: Keeping a finger over the hole at the end, try to press down on the
plunger.

 * Students answer the question: Can a solid be compressed?

Step 4: Tip out the sand and repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 with water (a liquid). 

 * Students answer the question: Can a liquid be compressed?

Step 5: Tip out the water and repeat steps 1,2 and 3 with just air (a gas) in
the syringe. 

 * Students answer the question: Can a gas be compressed? 

Students write a conclusion for this investigation about which states of matters
can be compressed.

If the plunger is positioned against the end of the sand or water, students
should not be able to push it down any further. Solids and liquids have a fixed
volume (they take up a certain amount of space) and cannot be compressed.
Students should find it relatively easy to push the plunger down on a syringe
full of air (although it gets harder the further they go, and the plunger will
bounce back when they let go). Gases have no fixed volume and can be compressed
(they can be made to take up less space).
Suggested that the students complete this activity with a partner or small
group. Using the interactive, students sort the following nine objects (stop
sign, honey, window, tomato, empty jar, fish tank, post box, glue, chewing gum)
into three groups of three so that the objects in each group all have a common
property.

Students then decide on a name that best describes each group. They then share
and compare their ideas with the class.

Property of each group:

Group 1 - all red

Group 2 - all sticky

Group 3 - all made of glass (or transparent)
Students explore the interactive The States of Matter.

Have them then talk to a partner about the information they have discovered.

In the 1920s scientists described a fourth state of matter. This state is called
plasma. Scientists believe there is more plasma in the universe than any other
state of matter! Students think of three places where they might find plasma.
They research to check whether they were correct and to find out more
information about plasma. Students use their research to complete the Colour,
Symbol, and Image thinking routine and explain the reason for their choices.

Plasma is found in every star in the universe, as well as lightning, and the
northern and southern lights. Artificial plasmas are created inside TV and
computer screens, fluorescent lights and plasma balls. Plasma is formed when a
gas is heated to a high temperature. Plasma has different properties to gas – it
can conduct electricity and is affected by magnetic fields.
Students list some properties to describe the following substances: the ‘Ooho’
water orb, sponge, toothpaste . They use their list to decide which state, or
states of matter, they would use to describe each item.

The Ooho water orb is soft, light, and flexible – its shape can be changed, but
it cannot be compressed. It is liquid water inside a thin solid film (wrap). The
liquid takes the shape of its container. The water orb could be described as a
liquid and a solid.

A sponge is soft and light. It absorbs water. However, it can be compressed
(squeezed). This is because it is actually a foam – a combination of a solid and
a gas. A sponge has thousands of little air pockets which can be compressed when
you squeeze the sponge. The sponge is therefore a combination of a gas and a
solid.

Toothpaste is soft and sticky like a liquid. It can be squeezed, but not poured
and will hold its shape. Toothpaste (like jelly) is a gel – liquid with lots of
tiny solid particles mixed into it.
Ask students to draw an example of each type of matter and then describe the
properties of each matter to explain why it can be sorted into a category.
