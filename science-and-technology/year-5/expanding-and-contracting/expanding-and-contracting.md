**Year:** Year 5

**Lesson ID:** 657

**Lesson name:** Expanding and Contracting

**Lesson duration:** 70 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What happens when we heat and cool matter?

**Focus question image:**
Shattered blue glass bottles mixed with ice in a freezer compartment.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this Chemical Sciences (Material World) lesson, students explore the effect of heat on the three states of matter. They view a dramatic video of shattering glass, which they return to at the end of the lesson to construct an explanation with their newfound knowledge. They conduct a practical exploration of expanding and contracting gases, and use the expansion and contraction of liquids to explain how a non-digital thermometer works. Scientific skills utilised in this lesson include: observing, explaining, applying knowledge and inferring.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Students view the stimulus image and share some ideas with a partner, and then
the class, about how they think the bottles of water might have broken. 

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Understand that all states of matter expand when heated, and contract when
- cooled.

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

Heating and cooling matter induces changes in its physical state and properties
due to alterations in temperature. In the context of the three states of matter
- solid, liquid, and gas - these changes are particularly pronounced.

When a matter is heated, its particles gain energy and begin to move more
rapidly, causing solids to melt into liquids and liquids to evaporate into gases
through processes known as melting and vaporisation, respectively.

Cooling matter results in the loss of energy from its particles, leading to a
decrease in movement and, consequently, changes in state, such as liquids
freezing into solids and gases condensing into liquids, termed solidification
and condensation, respectively.

The expansion and contraction of gases with temperature changes illustrate the
relationship between volume and temperature.

The functioning of a non-digital thermometer relies on the expansion and
contraction of liquids, typically mercury or alcohol, in response to temperature
fluctuations, showcasing the practical applications of these thermal phenomena.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

What happens when we heat and cool matter?

Share your ideas.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  

The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. In addition, the last
slide of the lesson displays the relevant words with definitions and images to
consolidate student understanding.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of what changes take place when we apply heat to matter.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Watch the video Glass Explosion.

Discuss the following questions:

 * What is happening in the video?

 * Describe the behaviour of the hot glass when it comes in contact with the
   cold water.

Then, go onto the next slide. Students complete the See Think Wonder questions
for the video.
Hands-On Investigation

Teacher demonstration: Water Breaks the Rules!

Teacher to collect materials in order to demonstrate Investigation 2.

Teacher to follow the steps to complete investigation.

Teacher fills a plastic bottle almost full of water. They mark the water level
with a marker, then stand it in the freezer overnight.

Teacher marks the new level. What has happened to the level of the water? 

(a) Students answer the question: Why is water ‘breaking the rules’?

A bottle filled with water and then frozen, will expand as it turns into ice. As
a result, the volume of the ice formed will be greater than the volume of the
liquid water that was initially in the bottle.

(b) They look at the cover photo and explain how the bottles broke.

As water freezes, it expands in volume. The expansion of the ice exerts pressure
on the walls of the glass bottle. The stress on the glass becomes too much and
the glass shatters.
Students view the stimulus video of a liquid thermometer responding to warming
weather.

Many thermometers are digital devices that we point at a person’s head, but
before we had digital thermometers, we had liquid ones!

Suggested Questions:

 * What happens to the liquid in the thermometer as the temperature increases?
   
   As the temperature increases, the liquid inside the thermometer expands.
   
   

 * Why does the liquid rise up the tube?
   
   The liquid rises up the tube of the thermometer due to expansion, which
   causes the liquid to expand with increasing temperature.
   
   

 * How does this demonstrate the principle of expansion?
   
   The rising of the liquid in the thermometer as the temperature increases
   serves as a tangible demonstration of the principle of expansion, showing how
   substances increase in volume when heated.
Using what they have learnt so far, students explain how the liquid inside the
thermometer moves.

A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It typically consists of
a narrow, sealed glass tube containing a liquid such as mercury or alcohol. The
liquid expands or contracts as it heats up or cools down, causing it to rise or
fall within the tube. The temperature is then read from a scale marked on the
tube.
Students view the stimulus video Glass Explosion again.

They make a sketch of the glass jug being heated and a sketch of cold water
being dropped into the hot glass to show their understanding.

Students explain in writing why the glass shatters.

The glass shatters because ...

Possible Answer

The glass shatters because of the rapid and uneven cooling of the hot glass by
cold water which creates significant stress within the glass material. Glass is
fragile—it cannot easily accommodate such stress.

The stress exceeds the strength of the glass, leading to the formation of
cracks. These cracks spread rapidly through the glass, causing it to shatter
into small pieces.

This phenomenon is known as thermal shock, where sudden temperature changes make
things break!
Students answer the following question: Why does running the lid of a jar under
hot water help you to get it off? 

When you run hot water over the lid of a jar, it causes the lid to expand
slightly due to the heat.

They name another time this action might be useful.

Some examples include:

 * Dealing with jars that have been tightly closed for a long time.

 * Dealing with jars that have been stored in a refrigerator or freezer for an
   extended period.

 * Dealing with jars containing thick or sticky substances that have dried
   around the lid.
Students observe the stimulus image. These structures can be found on bridges.

Students explain why they think they are there.

Suggested Questions:

 * How do bridges expand and contract with temperature changes?

 * Why are expansion joints important for the structural integrity of bridges?

 * What might happen if bridges did not have expansion joints?
   
   

Expansion joints are commonly found on bridges and other structures to
accommodate the expansion and contraction of materials due to temperature
changes, seismic activity, and other factors.

They are essential components of bridge design and help ensure the safety,
longevity, and functionality of the bridge structure.
Hands-On Investigation 

Teacher demonstration: The Amazing Self-Inflating Balloon.

Teacher instructions:

Gather the materials and set up the demonstration. Explain that this
investigation will explore how air expands and contracts with temperature
changes.

Student Activity:

Students will predict what will happen to the balloon when the bottle is placed
in hot water. They will then observe the demonstration and record their
observations, drawing what happens to the balloon in both hot and cold water.
Finally, they will explain their observations based on the principles of
expansion and contraction.

After watching the investigation, students can engage in critical thinking and
analysis by discussing the underlying principles of heat and cool, predicting
the outcome of variations in the experiment, and explaining any results.

Suggested Questions:

 * Why did the balloon inflate when the bottle was placed in hot water?
   
   
   
   As air inside the bottle heats up, its pressure increases. The increased
   pressure pushes against the balloon, causing it to inflate.
   
   

 * Why did the balloon deflate when the bottle was placed in cold water?
   
   
   
   The decrease in temperature causes a decrease in air pressure inside the
   bottle, leading to the balloon's deflation.
   
   

 * How does this demonstration illustrate the expansion and contraction of
   gases?
   
   
   
   The demonstration illustrates the fundamental principles of expansion and
   contraction of gases, as well as the relationship between temperature,
   pressure, and volume in a closed system.

[Statement Box] When matter is heated, it expands. It gets bigger and increases in volume (it
takes up more space).

When matter is cooled, it contracts. It gets smaller and decreases in volume (it
takes up less space).

This is true for solids, liquids and gases.
