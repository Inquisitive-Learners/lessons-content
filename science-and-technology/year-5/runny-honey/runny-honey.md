**Year:** Year 5

**Lesson ID:** 656

**Lesson name:** Runny Honey

**Lesson duration:** 110 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Which liquid is the ‘runniest’?

**Focus question image:**
Lava flows down a rocky surface, glowing brightly against a twilight sky.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this Chemical Sciences (Material World) lesson students are introduced to a property of liquid called viscosity, through an engaging video of a very familiar liquid – tomato sauce. They then design and conduct an experiment to test and compare the viscosity of a number of household liquids. Scientific skills utilised in this lesson include hypothesising, fair testing, observing, measuring, recording, concluding and evaluating.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
To stimulate interest and curiosity about Chemical Sciences Material World,
students view the stimulus image and turn and talk to a partner about the
following questions:

 * What is happening in this photo? 

 * What property of liquids can you see in action?

Have them consider the question:

 * Is lava a liquid?

Lava is a liquid, that cools into rock, which is a solid. Lava is molten rock (a
liquid) that flows on the earth's surface. Lava is formed inside the crust of
the Earth by extreme heat; it erupts to form a volcano.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Understand that viscosity is the ability of liquids to flow.
- Make a hypothesis, plan and carry out an experimental procedure, record
- results and form a conclusion.

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

Viscosity is a term used to describe how easily a liquid flows. It helps us
understand how thick or thin a liquid is. Imagine pouring syrup and water from a
bottle – syrup flows slowly because it's thick and has high viscosity, while
water flows quickly because it's thin and has low viscosity.

To explain viscosity, you can use everyday examples like honey, oil, and water
to illustrate the concept. You can also conduct simple experiments where
students compare the flow of different liquids and observe how viscosity affects
their behaviour. By understanding viscosity, students can learn about the
physical properties of liquids and how they interact with each other and their
environment.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
Revisit the focus question:

 * Which liquid is the runniest?

Ask students to share their ideas.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  

The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. In addition, the last
slide of the lesson displays the relevant words with definitions and images to
consolidate student understanding.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding that viscosity is the ability of liquids to flow.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students imagine they are in the testing laboratory. With a partner, they
conduct an experiment to compare the viscosity of some other household liquids.
They can choose from condiments, sweeteners or bathroom products.

Students use the provided scientific process to plan and carry out their
experiment. 

Aim (What are you trying to find out?)

Method: Collect the equipment listed on page 2, plus three liquids they would
like to test.

Procedure: Discuss with your partner what you will need to do. 

Students read the scientist’s tips to help them. 

 1. Think of this experiment as a race. Make the liquids flow down a smooth race
    track (e.g. tray or tile) and time how long they take to get to the end.

 2. Your race track will need to be straight and each liquid in the race must
    travel the same distance.

Write the steps they will take.

Draw a diagram of their experiment set up.

Aim – Sample answers: To find out which of the following liquids has the highest
(/lowest) viscosity. To see which liquid will run the fastest down the plate.

Procedure – Sample answers:

 * Mark a ‘start’ and ‘finish’ line on the plate/tray.

 * Use the spoons to measure out the same amount of each liquid onto start line.

 * Tip up the plate and start the timer.

 * Time how long it takes for each liquid to reach the finish line.

(If timing more than one liquid at a time proves challenging, simply perform the
test one liquid at a time, cleaning the plate/tray thoroughly in between).
Students look at the provided images of different liquids: water, honey,
custard, medicine, juice. They number them from 1-5 according to how viscous
(runny) they think they are.
Have students watch the video, then have a class discussion about the questions.

 * What did the man in the video do?

 * What did it show?

Then read the information statement, introducing the term viscosity.
In October 2020, a new type of squeezable Vegemite was introduced. Students
answer the following questions:

 * Would squeezy Vegemite have a higher or lower viscosity than regular Vegemite
   in a jar?

 * What might have been added to or taken out of regular Vegemite to make it
   squeezable?

Some Vegemite fans have criticised the new squeezable version, preferring the
jar version. Think of at least two reasons why this might be.

Possible answers:

a. In order to be squeezable, it would appear that the new style of Vegemite
would have a lower viscosity.

b. Water could have been added to ‘thin it out’, or less of a solid ingredient
added.

c. Answers will vary
Students Explore the University of Queensland Maths and Physics website to find
out about the Pitch Drop experiment, the longest-running laboratory experiment
that was created in 1927 by Thomas Parnell, UQ's first Professor of Physics.
They think about the plus and minus points of doing the experiment and represent
their thinking on the provided PMI chart. Students also answer if they think
pitch is a liquid or a solid, giving a reason for their answer.

Answers will vary. Some students may argue that the drips, no matter how slowly
they come, are evidence that pitch is a liquid. Others may argue that for all
intents and purposes, it is behaving like a solid. The University of Queensland
website describes it as ‘the world’s thickest known fluid.’ Glass has been
observed to display similar behaviour – the windows of very old buildings are
thicker at the bottom than the top, suggesting that glass ‘flows’.
Have students draw and describe about three different types of liquids with
variable viscosities.
Conclusion: Students answer the following:

 * Answer your aim by stating what you have found out from doing this
   experiment.

 * Was your hypothesis correct (or partially correct)?

 * Can you predict the viscosity of a liquid based on how it looks? 

Evaluation: Students discuss these questions with their partner:

 * What challenges did you experience while doing this experiment?

 * If you were to do this experiment again, what would you change or improve?

Conclusion

Answers will vary, but students should be able to summarise their results and
describe which liquids had the highest and lowest viscosity. Their hypothesis
may have been partially correct as they may have correctly predicted the results
for one or two liquids. Generally speaking, the thicker-looking the liquid, the
higher its viscosity.

Evaluation

Answers will vary, but students may have experienced difficulties accurately
measuring or transferring sticky liquids to the correct spot on the plate.
Fair Testing

A variable is anything that could affect the result of an experiment. To make an
experiment a fair test, we can only change one variable at a time. The rest we
must keep the same. Students answer the following questions:

 * What variable are you changing? 

 * What variables are you keeping the same?

 * What variable are you measuring? (what are you recording in the results
   section?) 

Hypothesis (Predicting the results of the experiment, based on what they already
know).

Students now conduct the experiment, recording their results as they go in the
provided table, jotting down the type of liquid and time taken to flow to the
end.

Fair Testing:

 1. What variable are you changing? The type of liquid.

 2. What variables are you keeping the same? The amount of each liquid, the
    plate they are travelling on, the distance they are travelling, the angle at
    which the plate is tipped up.

 3. What variable are you measuring? (What are you recording in the results
    section?) The time taken to travel a certain distance.
