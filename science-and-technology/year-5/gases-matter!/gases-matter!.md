**Year:** Year 5

**Lesson ID:** 655

**Lesson name:** Gases Matter!

**Lesson duration:** 145 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What is a gas?

**Focus question image:**
A person suspended from colourful balloons floats against a clear blue sky.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this Chemical Sciences (Material World) lesson, students investigate the behaviour of gases and connect it to their properties. To overcome the fact that many gases can not be seen, students listen to a compilation of familiar sounds, all caused by the movement of air (a mixture of gases). They perform two other short investigations and relate their observations to the properties of gases. Scientific skills utilised in this lesson include: listening, predicting, observing and explaining.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image of a man named Larry Walters who attached some balloons
to a chair and flew nearly 5km up into the air on the 2nd July 1982.

Ask students:

 * How many balloons do you think he used, and what did he put in them?

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students will be able to:
- Relate observations of gas behaviour to its properties.

**TEACHER READING:**
Background Science

To effectively teach the lesson 'Gases Matter' it is crucial to understand, and
be able to explain, several key concepts related to gases and their properties,
as well as how gases differ from other states of matter like solids and liquids.

There are four basic states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Molecules
behave differently in each state. In solids, molecules are closely packed and
have limited movement. In liquids, molecules are less tightly packed and can
move more freely. In gases, molecules are far apart and move very freely.

Gas Properties and Behaviour: Gases occupy any container they are in, spreading
out to fill the space available. This behaviour contrasts with solids and
liquids and is a key characteristic of gases. Gases can be compressed (pressed
into a smaller volume) and they expand to fill the space available.

Pressure, Volume, and Temperature: These are the three variables in gases. A
basic understanding of Boyle's law (the pressure of a gas tends to increase as
the volume of the container decreases, provided the temperature of the gas does
not change) and Charles's law (the volume of a gas increases with increasing
temperature, provided the gas pressure does not change).

Breathable Air and Atmosphere: The composition of air (a mixture of gases
including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and others). The atmosphere is a
layer of gases surrounding Earth. Air pressure is the weight of the atmosphere
pressing down on Earth.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What is a gas?

Ask students to share their ideas.

**NOTES:**
Answer

Larry used 43 large (2.4m diameter) weather balloons. He inflated them with a
gas called helium, which he bought in large tanks. Helium is less dense than
air. This means that a balloon filled with helium is lighter than a balloon
filled with air. Helium balloons will rise up and float on top of the air in the
Earth’s atmosphere.
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson.  

The vocabulary words appear in bold within the lesson. In addition, the last
slide of the lesson displays the relevant words with definitions and images to
consolidate student understanding.
Air is a mixture of gases, mostly nitrogen and oxygen. Like solids and liquids,
gases are matter. We can identify gases by their properties and their behaviour:

 * take the shape of their container

 * have mass

 * have volume

 * can be compressed

 * flow (move from form one place to another)
Answers

Sound 1: Strong wind

Sound 2: Blowing out candles

Sound 3: Blowing up a balloon

Sound 4: Letting the air out of a balloon

Sound 5: Pumping up a bike tyre

These sounds all have air (specifically, moving air) in common.
Answers

The property of gases demonstrated by this activity is that gases (in this case
air) take up space. The paper does not get wet because there is air stuck in the
cup that the water cannot get past. Tilting the cup slightly allows some air to
escape. A big bubble rises to the top of the water and bursts – this is the
sound that is heard. If enough air is allowed to escape in this manner, the
water level will be able to rise up to wet the paper.
Answers

The property of gases demonstrated by this activity is that gases take the shape
of their container. When the baking soda is added, it is imperative that the bag
is zipped up as quickly as possible. The chemical reaction that takes place
produces the gas, carbon dioxide, which quickly inflates the bag.
Answers

Answers might include: cooking smells (such as baking or frying), the smell of
flowers or cut grass, the smell of paint or petrol, the smell of the rubbish bin
or compost heap and bathroom or toilet smells!

Gases flow. They move from one place to another. This is why you can smell the
smell of a cake baking in the kitchen from your bedroom. An interesting
discussion point is that natural gas, which many students will have piped into
their houses, does not have an odour. A smelly compound called Ethyl Mercaptan
is added, so that we can tell if we have a gas leak.
Answers will vary.
Answers

A full air tank will feel heavier than an empty one, as it has more air inside,
and air has mass. Alternatively, the opening of a full tank could be placed in
water and bubbles would appear as gas came out.

An ‘empty’ air tank still has air in it, just as an empty bottle does. All of
the compressed (‘pressurised’) gas that was forced into the tank to fill it, has
come out.
Answers

Fan and bike pump

Air is being pulled in and then pushed out of the pump through the tube. If you
block the end with your finger, you can still push the pump a little way,
because the air inside is being compressed

Balloon breath

It is moving into our body – it flows through our nose and trachea (windpipe)
and into our lungs – and out again.

Air is being forced from our lungs into the balloon, which stretches to allow
more air in.

Air moves out of the balloon through the narrow opening. The vibrating air makes
the squeaky sound.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of relating observations of gas behaviour to its properties.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Hands-On Investigation

Students will dive into Investigation 3: Gas Bag, where they will use a small
sealable bag, vinegar, and baking soda to explore chemical reactions that
produce gas. This investigation instructs students to combine the ingredients
and carefully observe the bag's reaction, aiming to understand how gases can be
created through chemical reactions and how they occupy space. This investigation
is designed to deepen students' comprehension of gases and their properties by
witnessing firsthand the expansion of a bag due to gas production.

Students collect the materials and complete the hands on investigation Gas Bag.

 * Have one person hold the bag open while another pours in vinegar to a depth
   of about two fingers high.

 * Pinch the sides of the bag closed, so it will be easy to zip up quickly.

 * Add one teaspoon of baking soda into the bag and zip it up quickly.

Students draw and annotate what happens. Then, they explain why it happens
before finally answering the question: What property of gases does this
investigation demonstrate?

Students should use a 'snack size' ziplock bag (there is another size called
sandwich size). Students should add vinegar (from a small cup, or perhaps use a
pipette) until it is 'two fingers' deep.
To kickstart the exploration of gases, students will engage in the Name That
Sound! activity, where they will listen to an audio clip featuring five distinct
sounds. The task for students is to listen carefully and write down their
guesses regarding what each sound represents. This activity aims to foster
listening skills and spark curiosity about the commonality of matter in the
sounds heard, serving as an interactive introduction to the topic of gases and
their properties.
Investigation 2: Waterproof Paper

Students will conduct a simple experiment using a cup, tissue or paper towel,
and water to explore the behaviour of gases under different conditions. They
will follow step-by-step instructions to submerge a cup with tissue at the
bottom, into water and observe whether it stays dry or gets wet, and identify
the sound heard during the process. This activity demystifies the concept of
gases occupying space and tangibly demonstrates their properties, encouraging
students to make predictions, observe outcomes, and explain their observations
based on understanding the properties of gases. Finally, they answer questions
about the properties of gases demonstrated in this investigation.

Students collect the materials and complete the following steps:

 * Scrunch up the tissue/paper towel and wedge it into the bottom of the cup.
   Students could use a small amount of tape to hold it in place.

 * Hold the cup upside down over the water. Students predict what will happen to
   the paper if you lower the cup down into the water.

 * Lower it quickly down to the bottom of the bowl. Students write their
   observations thinking about what happened to the paper.

 * Lift the cup straight up out of the water. Dry around the edge, then feel the
   paper. Students write an explanation for what they observed and felt.

 * Repeat steps 2-5. Holding the cup at the bottom, tilt it by lifting up one
   side until you hear a sound. Students discuss some ideas about what makes the
   sound.
Students write around the nose all the odours (gases) that they might smell in
their house or garden. Sometimes we can smell these gases from a long way away.
Students answer the question: What property of gases makes us able to do this?
Students view the stimulus video about a substance called Aerogel, which is 99%
gas. Aerogel is a good insulator (a substance that does not let heat through it
easily), but it is expensive so it is not often used. NASA is working on using
Aerogel in a spacesuit to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures in space.

Students explain how an astronaut and a firefighter could benefit from Aerogel.
They also predict three more products that might contain Aerogel in the future.
Students imagine that they are a scuba diver preparing for a dive. Then they
answer the following questions:

How could you tell the difference between a full air tank and an empty one?

What do you think is inside an ‘empty’ air tank?
Investigation 1: Moving Air

Students will embark on the first hands-on investigation of Moving Air,
utilising simple materials such as balloons, an electric fan, and a bike pump,
to perform tasks that visibly demonstrate air movement.

 * Stand in front of a fan or air conditioner. Remind students not to touch the
   fan.

 * Pump a bike pump. Put your hand in front of the opening as you pump.

 * Take a big, long, slow breath in. Then breathe out slowly.

 * Blow up a balloon. Hold the end closed without tying it off.

 * Slowly let the air out of your balloon by pinching the sides of the opening.

Through guided investigations, they will observe and document the behaviour of
air as they interact with it in various ways. Students can use the words in the
balloons to help them. This investigation is designed to develop students'
understanding of air's physical properties and its responsiveness to different
forms of manipulation.
Explain to students that we can identify gases by their properties and
behaviours. Gas has volume, mass, can be compressed, can flow from one place to
another and can change shape.

Have students turn away from the screen and test each other to see if they can
remember all five properties. They could then share their ideas about each
property.
