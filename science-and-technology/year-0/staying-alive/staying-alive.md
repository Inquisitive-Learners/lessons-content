**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 524

**Lesson name:** Staying Alive

**Lesson duration:** 60 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What keeps plants alive?

**Focus question image:**
Hands cradle a small grassy island with a tree against a sunny, green backdrop.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore what plants need to live and grow. They begin by identifying plants as living things and examining images of a plant in both healthy and unhealthy states, considering what might have caused the difference. The concept that plants need water is introduced through a timelapse video showing how water affects a plant in dry soil. Next, students observe an experiment that tests the importance of light for plant growth. They record their observations, discuss their findings and conclude that both water and sunlight are essential for plants to thrive.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the opening image and ask them what they think the person who
created this image is trying to make us feel or think about trees. Read the
focus question, 'What keeps plants alive?' Document and use the students’
responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify
any misconceptions. 

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Identify what plants need to live and grow.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Use their observational skills to identify how plants differ or how they have
- changed.
- Understand that plants need water and light to stay alive.

**TEACHER READING:**
Plants require specific conditions to survive and thrive. These essential needs
include:

Sunlight: Sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis, the process by which plants
convert light energy into chemical energy, producing food in the form of
glucose. Without adequate sunlight, plants cannot generate the energy required
for growth, development and reproduction.

Water: Water plays a vital role in the life of a plant. It is necessary for
transporting nutrients and minerals from the soil to different parts of the
plant. Water also helps maintain the plant's structure and supports the chemical
reactions involved in photosynthesis.

Air: Plants require carbon dioxide from the air to perform photosynthesis.
Carbon dioxide combines with water and sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen.
The oxygen released during this process is essential for the survival of many
living organisms, including humans.

Nutrients: Plants obtain essential nutrients and minerals from the soil, such as
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. These nutrients are necessary for
various plant functions, including cell growth, root development and overall
health. Deficiencies in these nutrients can lead to poor plant growth and
reduced productivity.

Space: Adequate space is important for plants to spread their roots and access
the water and nutrients they need from the soil. Sufficient space also allows
for proper air circulation around the plant, reducing the risk of disease.

When plants receive the right amount of sunlight, water, air, nutrients and
space, they can grow, develop and reproduce successfully.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What keeps plants alive?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to identify what plants need to live and grow.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Ask students to look carefully at the living things they can see in the photos
and name what they see. Discuss what they think they all need to live and grow.
Introduce the idea that plants need water by showing students two images of the
same plant. In the first image, the plant has droopy, wilted leaves and in the
second image, the plant has healthy, green leaves. Ask the students to compare
the two images, discussing how the plants look different. Students then share
their thoughts on what might have happened to make the plant look healthy in the
second image.

Part 2 of 2

Students watch a time-lapse video of the plant being watered and coming back to
life. Ask them to turn and talk to a classmate to describe what they saw
happening. Ensure students understand that the plant needed water.
Use the statement box to reiterate to students that all plants need water to
stay alive. Have them work in pairs to act out a thirsty plant being watered,
demonstrating their understanding of the importance of water in keeping plants
healthy. Finish the activity by asking students what else they think a plant
needs.
Students draw and colour how each of the plants looked at the end of the video.
Explain that they should draw the plant that received sunlight in the cup with
the picture of the sun on it. They should draw the plant that did not receive
sunlight in the cup with black paper around it. If necessary, play the video
again to remind students what happened to each plant.

**ACTIVITY 4:**
Description: The key understanding that plants need light to grow healthily and survive is
now being explored. Students watch the Plants and Light video, which shows a
child planting cress seeds in two cups and growing them under different
conditions: one cup is exposed to sunlight, and the other is kept in the dark.

When discussing why there was a difference between the plants, some students may
suggest reasons other than light deprivation, such as one plant not receiving
water. Confirm to students that both plants were watered (even though this isn’t
directly shown in the video). Redirect their attention to the labels they saw
attached to the plants in the video. Guide their thinking by saying, 'One plant
was covered by a container. There was something it didn’t receive that the other
plant did. What was that?'
