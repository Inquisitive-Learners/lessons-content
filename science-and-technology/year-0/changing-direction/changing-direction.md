**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 685

**Lesson name:** Changing Direction

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Which way will it go?

**Focus question image:**
Cricketer in white kit strikes a red ball with the bat, crowd in background.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
n this lesson, students explore how pushes and pulls change an object's direction. They start by watching a pinball machine video, discussing how the ball moves through the machine. After playing a class pinball game and observing changes in the ball's direction, students learn that direction is the path an object follows. They use arrows in illustrations to show the direction of forces, identifying pushes and pulls. Next, they discuss how a mini-golf ball changes direction when hitting obstacles and then work in groups to design a mini-golf hole. Finally, students draw their design, marking changes in the ball's direction with arrows.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and check that they recognise what sport is shown. Talk
about how a cricket ball moves in a game; it can be hit or thrown. Ask students
to point in the direction that the ball would be travelling in seconds after the
photo was taken. Read the focus question, 'Which way will it go?' Document and
use the students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the
topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Understand how forces like pushing and pulling can change the direction of
- objects and how obstacles influence movement.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Recognise that a push moves an object away and a pull brings it closer.
- Identify when an object is being pushed or pulled and how this changes its
- direction.
- Understand that objects change direction when they bump into obstacles.
- Use arrows to show the direction of forces acting on objects.
- Design and develop a product that uses forces to create change.
- Collaborate with peers to plan and test how different materials and obstacles
- affect a ball’s movement.

**TEACHER READING:**
When an object encounters another force or obstacle, it changes direction. For
example:

 * In pinball, the ball changes direction when it hits bumpers, altering its
   path through pushes and pulls.

 * In mini golf, the ball changes direction when it hits walls, ramps or
   obstacles like books or blocks.

Direction is the path an object follows when moving. Pushes and pulls can alter
this path, especially when the object hits something. Arrows are a visual way to
show the direction of forces acting on objects.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Which way will it go?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to understand how forces like pushing and pulling can change the
direction of objects and how obstacles influence movement.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Explain what mini golf is. Ask students to look at the images and discuss with a
partner:

 * What things could the ball hit?

 * What could happen if the ball hit anything else?

Part 2 of 3

Watch the short video of a homemade mini-golf hole. Facilitate a discussion
about the obstacles, drawing students' attention to how the ball moved when it
hit something, such as the paint brush.

Explain to students that they will work in small groups to make one hole for a
mini-golf course. Direct their attention back to the image of the homemade
mini-golf hole. Discuss what things were used for the ball to bump into and what
they could use. Provide an array of materials for students to use as their
obstacles:

 * Books

 * Crayon boxes

 * Blocks

Students will also need to make mini-golf clubs (these could be made out of
cardboard tubes, interlocking blocks, or small sticks) and small balls (such as
ping-pong balls or marbles).

Allow time for group discussion, circulating to listen to students' ideas. To
provoke thinking, pose the following questions:

 * What materials do you need?

 * What should you do first, next and last?

 * How can you get the ball to change direction?

 * How many objects should you include?

Part 3 of 3

Students work together to build their mini-golf hole and try it out. To finish
the activity, they draw what they made, circling the parts that caused the ball
to change direction and arrows to show which way the ball moved.
The use of arrows to indicate the direction of a force is introduced. The
students observe several illustrations and discuss the direction of the force,
and whether it is a push or a pull. Remind them that a push moves something away
from you, and a pull moves something towards you.
Explain to students that direction is the path an object takes when it moves.
Pushes and pulls can cause objects to change direction. Discuss how objects
change direction or move in different directions when they bump into other
objects. 

Before viewing the video, tell students they will see lots of objects changing
direction and they should try to remember as many as they can. After watching
the video, have students share which objects they saw change direction and how
those directions were changed. 
Clear an area in the classroom, or take students outside, to explore changing
the direction of a ball. Play a class pinball machine game. You will need a big,
soft ball.  Read the rules of the game, and then ask students to stand in a big
circle holding hands.Ask students to take turns to push or pull the ball in
different directions. Talk about how the ball moves and how they can make it
change direction.
Before students watch the video, have them share any experiences they may have
had with pinball machines. Play the video and use the questions on the page to
discuss what happens to the ball as it moves through the pinball machine. Help
students understand that the ball was pushed. Firstly, the player pulled the
stick back, which then pushed the ball forward. The ball was then pushed when
the different objects were moved.
View the Dominoes Maze video, and discuss what happened when the dominoes fell
down. Encourage students to think about how the whole set-up turned corners and
created shapes. When each domino fell down, it changed direction and changed the
direction of the next domino too.

Challenge students to make a maze of dominoes that winds around objects or
branches off in various directions. Have small groups of students work together
and then share their design with the class, before seeing if it works. The
activity concludes with students recording what happened when the dominoes fell
down.
This activity delves deeper into forces and motion by challenging students to
design their own pinball game. Replay the video from the beginning of the lesson
to help provide inspiration for students’ own design ideas. Remind students that
their design needs to include several obstacles in order for the ball to change
direction, and that some obstacles can move back and forth.
