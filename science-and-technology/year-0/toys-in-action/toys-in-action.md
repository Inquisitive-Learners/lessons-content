**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 721

**Lesson name:** Toys in Action

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How do toys work?

**Focus question image:**
Four children playing with kendama toys against a white wall.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore how pushes, pulls and twists make toys move. After watching a video of a child playing with a kendama, they identify the forces used to move and catch the ball. Students then learn about First Nations Peoples spinning tops, selecting one from the Australian Museum website to discuss and draw. They learn that a twist combines pushing and pulling, before brainstorming other twisting objects. Finally, students make their own spinning tops, drawing and labelling how they move.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
View the image and ask the focus question, 'How do toys work?' Remind students
of the previous work they have done, showing how objects move using a push or a
pull force. Document and use the students’ responses to the focus question to
help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys move.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Recognise how pushing and pulling affect the movement of a toy.
- Identify how spinning tops from First Nations Peoples of Australia's culture
- are made and how they move.
- Understand that a twist is a combination of a push and a pull.
- Create their own spinning top and explain how they used forces to make it
- move.
- Draw and label the steps involved in making and moving their spinning top.

**TEACHER READING:**
Several types of contact forces are evident in First Nations Peoples'
instructional toys and games, including applied force, frictional force and
air-resistance.

Applied force is force exerted directly on an object resulting in movement of
the object, such as a throw, push or pull. 

Frictional force is a force that occurs when two surfaces rub against each
other. It opposes the motion of an object, making it harder for the object to
move.

Air resistance, also known as drag, is a force that opposes the motion of an
object as it moves through the air. It occurs because air molecules collide with
the surface of the object, creating a pushing force against its direction of
movement.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How do toys work?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to understand how forces like pushing, pulling and twisting make toys
move.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Explain to students that a kendama is a traditional Japanese toy. It has a
wooden ball attached with a string to a wooden handle. Watch the video of the
child playing with the kendama toy. Direct students to think about which part of
the toy is being pushed and which part is being pulled. 
Direct students’ attention to the first image, explaining that when we push the
stick, it can help the ball go up into the air. Then direct them to the next
image and explain when we pull the stick, it can help us catch the ball on the
cup or spike. Emphasise how each force makes the toy work. Allow students some
time to view the images, and if need be, to watch the kendama video again. 
Explain to students that many cultures make toys that use pushes and pulls. For
example, the First Nations Peoples of Australia and Torres Strait Islander
Peoples have a rich history of using spinning tops as both children's toys and
as part of a sporting game played by young men.

Have students explore the Australian Museum’s website to view what the First
Nations Australians' spinning tops toys looked like. Ask them to choose one of
the spinning tops and talk about how it was made, then draw what it looks like.

Part 2 of 2

Click on the picture to watch another type of spinning top in action. Discuss
why and how the the spinning top moved.
Students learn that a twist can be described as a combination of a push and a
pull. Ask the students to think of, and draw some other examples of things they
can twist.
Students make their own spinning top. Assist them to collect the materials they
need and encourage them to view the images closely. Students draw and label how
they made their spinning top move. 
Students now design their own spinning top. Remind them of the video they
watched, and explain how their design needs to show how a push or a pull makes
it move. Students consider how they could make their spinning top go faster,
before drawing and labelling what happened in the space provided.
This activity challenges students with a different game, applying their
understanding of push and pull forces in a new context. Direct students’
attention to the picture of the boy playing a game of Totem Tennis. Explain that
Totem Tennis is a game where you hit a ball that is attached to a pole by a
rope. Ask them to think about the forces used when playing Totem Tennis.
Students then draw and label a design to show these forces in action. Extend
students' thinking by asking how they would make the ball go faster.
