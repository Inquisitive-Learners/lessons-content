**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 865

**Lesson name:** I'm Thirsty

**Lesson duration:** 90 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Do we all need water?

**Focus question image:**
Zebras, antelopes, and an oryx drink from a waterhole in a grassy savannah scene.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, the concept that water is essential to all living things is explored. The lesson begins with students discussing, observing and mimicking how animals drink water. They then consider how plants obtain water, sharing and justifying their ideas with others. Through participation in a guided investigation into how water travels through plants, students pose and respond to questions, make observations using their senses, and engage in discussions. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Begin the lesson by showing students the image of zebras and gemsbok drinking
water at a watering hole. Ask them to describe what they see in the image.
Encourage them to think about why the animals are gathered at the watering hole.
Then pose the focus question, 'Do we all need water?' Document and use the
students' responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Identify different ways that animals and plants obtain water.
- Participate in a guided investigation.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that all living things need water to survive.
- Know that most animals use their mouths to drink water.
- Know that plants absorb water through their roots, and this water then
- travels through their stems.
- Safely follow the steps of an investigation.
- Use their senses to make observations.
- Discuss the results of an investigation.

**TEACHER READING:**
All living things have basic needs that must be met for survival. Water is
crucial for the survival of all living organisms. It helps plants grow strong
and healthy, providing the necessary nutrients for their development. Animals
need water to stay alive. It is involved in various biological processes such as
digestion, nutrient transport and temperature regulation. We use water for
drinking, cooking and cleaning. Without water, living things cannot survive.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Do we all need water?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to participate in a guided investigation.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
To begin the lesson, students will explore the essential needs of living things
by identifying which items do not require water. This activity aims to develop
students' understanding of the basic needs of living things, specifically
focusing on water.

Guide the students to look at the provided images of a human, a rock, a flower
and a kitten. Ask them to consider which of these items does not need water and
why.
Building on the understanding of how animals drink water, students will now
explore how plants obtain water.

Guide students through a Think, Pair, Share activity where they first think
individually about how plants get water, then discuss their ideas with a
partner, and finally share their thoughts with the class. Use the provided
images of a child examining a plant, a tree with roots, a flower with raindrops,
a cactus and a water lily to stimulate their thinking.
Continuing from the exploration of how plants get water, students will now
conduct an investigation to understand how cut flowers absorb water. This
activity aims to develop students' inquiry skills and understanding of how
plants take in water, even when they are cut.

Guide students through the investigation by providing the materials: three cut
white flowers (or celery sticks with leaves if no flowers are available),
scissors for an adult to cut the stems, food colouring, clear cups and a jug of
water. Demonstrate how to prepare the flowers by making an angled cut on the
stems and placing them in cups filled with water, with one cup containing
coloured water.

Part 2 of 3

Guide students to draw a picture to match each step of the experiment. They
should get three cups, fill two of them halfway with water, and add food
colouring to one cup until the water is bright. Then, place a cut flower in each
cup.

As a class, discuss and predict what will happen to each flower.

Part 3 of 3

Students will now observe and record the results. This activity aims to develop
students' observation skills and understanding of how plants absorb water.

Guide students to closely observe each flower after one day. Have them draw what
they see and note any changes in the flowers, especially focusing on the flower
in the coloured water.

Discuss with the class what happens to a flower when it has no water and how a
flower drinks water from the cup.
Building on the understanding of how plants absorb water, students will now
personalise their learning by reflecting on their own need for water. This
activity aims to help students understand that they, too, as living things,
require water for various reasons, thereby reinforcing the universal need for
water among living things.

Guide students to draw and write reasons why they need water. Encourage them to
think about different uses of water in their daily lives, such as drinking,
bathing and helping their body function properly.
Students will engage in a creative activity that connects literature and science
by illustrating a famous line from an old poem. Guide students to draw what they
think the old man is seeing when he says, 'Water, water, everywhere, not a drop
to drink!' Use the provided image of a cartoon sea captain with a white beard
holding a ship's wheel to inspire their drawings. Discuss with the students why
the old man cannot drink the water.
