**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 459

**Lesson name:** Just What I Need

**Lesson duration:** 60 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What do animals need?

**Focus question image:**

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students describe the needs of animals and how those needs might be met. Through the context of pets, students learn about the basic needs of animals before applying  their scientific understanding to learn how to best care for pets. They investigate the specific requirements of common pets, including food, water, shelter, air, grooming, attention, exercise and play. Students then have the opportunity to create a class pet shop, allowing them to compare and contrast the needs of various pets. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
To stimulate interest and curiosity, discuss what students can see in the image
and ask the focus question, ‘What do animals need?’ Document and use the
students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions. 

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Describe the needs of animals and how those needs might be met.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Know that animals need air, water, food and shelter to stay alive.
- Understand that pets have needs that they often rely on humans to meet.
- Create a profile for a chosen pet, listing its needs.

**TEACHER READING:**
Animals have specific needs that must be met for their survival, including food,
water, air and shelter. These needs vary depending on the species and the
environment in which they live.

Food is essential as it provides animals with the energy and nutrients they
require for growth, movement and maintaining their bodily functions. Herbivores,
carnivores and omnivores have adapted to find or hunt their food sources based
on their dietary needs.

Water is crucial for all animals, as it plays a role in digestion, regulating
body temperature and transporting nutrients within their bodies. Some animals
get their water from the food they eat, while others actively seek water sources
like rivers, lakes or puddles.

Air is necessary for respiration, which is the process animals use to obtain
oxygen and release carbon dioxide. While most animals breathe air directly,
aquatic animals have adapted to extract oxygen from water using gills.

Shelter provides animals with protection from harsh weather conditions,
predators and other dangers in their environment. Animals have evolved to find
or create shelters that suit their specific needs, such as burrows, nests, dens
or tree hollows. Shelter also provides a safe space for resting, reproducing and
caring for their young.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What do animals need?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson. 

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
understanding of the needs of animals and how those needs might be met.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students learn that all animals need certain things to stay alive. They use the
picture prompts to ascertain what those things are (food, shelter, water, air)
and then consider why each is needed.
The concept of pets is introduced, providing a real-world context for students
to learn about and apply their knowledge of animals' needs. Work as a class to
record a list of all the pets students own or would like to own. Gather class
data by recording the number of students who own each pet. Take time to talk
about the variance of pets and ask students who is responsible for caring for
these pets in their homes. 
Tell students they will be working together to create a class pet shop. Have
students use playdough or modelling clay to make a model of a pet.

Part 2 of 3

Have students complete the Class Pet Shop Animal Profile, encouraging them to
consider their pet's basic needs. A worked example of a profile is provided on
the previous page to model the process for students. This example serves as a
guide, illustrating the necessary steps and details required for their own
profiles.

Part 3 of 3

Once students have finished creating their pets and profiles, organise a class
pet shop. Give students time to walk around the shop, observing each other's
pets and reading their profiles. Ask students which pets they would like to own
and how they would care for them. Also, discuss which pet would be the most
challenging to care for and why.
To take the learning further, students will draw or write what different animal
babies need.
This activity requires students to apply their critical-thinking skills as they
decide which of two animals would be more difficult to look after - a seal or a
llama. Students are expected to use the word 'because' in their explanation to
ensure they justify their choice.
To reinforce understanding of the basic needs of pets and compare their needs,
students complete the checklist to show what each pet needs. Depending on
student ability, this can be done as a whole class, paired or independent
activity.

Once students have completed populating the table, discuss the questions. As
students analyse the data in the table, support them to identify any patterns as
they compare pets with similar needs and determine which pet has the most needs.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
As a class, read together the eBook What does my dog need? In the book students
meet various dogs, all with different needs. While reading, discuss with
students whether they think all animals have the same needs as the dogs
presented in the book.

  Materials: Ball of play dough
