**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 686

**Lesson name:** Sliding or Rolling? 

**Lesson duration:** 60 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Why do some objects slide and some roll?

**Focus question image:**

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore how objects move by rolling or sliding. Using playdough, they create shapes that roll, and then flatten them to observe changes. The key understanding that  round objects roll due to curved surfaces while flat objects slide is introduced. Students investigate classroom objects on a ramp, recording whether they roll, slide or do both. The lesson ends with a discussion on moving large objects like logs or fridges, followed by students drawing their ideas on how they would move such objects. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image, and have them discuss what the boy might be doing and
what he is standing in. Read the focus question, 'Why do some objects slide and
some roll?' Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Explore and explain how different objects move by rolling or sliding.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify that round objects with curved surfaces roll, while flat objects
- slide.
- Experiment with playdough to create shapes that roll or slide.
- Recognise how objects move down a ramp and record their observations.
- Identify and draw objects in the classroom that roll, slide or do both.
- Describe ways to move larger objects like a log, fridge or car.

**TEACHER READING:**
Objects interact with surfaces in various ways, leading to different types of
movement.

Items like balls or cylinders, with curved surfaces, can smoothly roll due to
their rounded shape when in contact with a surface.

On the other hand, objects with flat surfaces are well-suited for sliding. When
positioned on an inclined surface, they effortlessly move or slide, minimising
resistance.

The fundamental factor influencing an object's movement is its shape.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why do some objects slide and some roll?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.
Consider showing the students videos of these vehicles.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to identify how different objects move by rolling or sliding.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students find and draw things in the classroom that they can:

 * Slide

 * Roll

 * Roll and slide
Tell students that balls are round and their curved surface makes them roll,
while objects with a flat surface can slide. Explain to students that they will
be investigating whether some everyday classroom objects roll or slide. Read the
instructions together. Assist students in collecting their materials and
creating a simple ramp using classroom items such as boxes and books.

Part 2 of 2

Students complete the investigation, recording their findings in the provided
table.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
Give students some playdough and ask them to make a shape that will roll. Next,
ask students to flatten the ball with their hands and try to make it move.
Encourage students to talk to their classmates about what they are doing.
Students watch the video Zorb Ball. It may be beneficial to watch the video more
than once. The first time for enjoyment and the second time to answer the
questions:

 * What was moving?

 * How did they move?

 * Did they move in different ways?
Sometimes, things are too big or heavy to move. Students look at the pictures of
a log, a fridge and a car and consider how they would move them. They draw and
label their ideas.
Students think of a name for the vehicle pictured and draw and label how they
think the vehicle moves. 
Direct students to look at the objects in each group. In the first group, they
need to decide which object does not roll and explain why that object does not
belong to the group. In the second group they have to choose which object does
not slide and explain why that object does not belong to the group.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Cubes, Sticky tape, Water bottle, Plastic egg, Book, Cardboard tube
