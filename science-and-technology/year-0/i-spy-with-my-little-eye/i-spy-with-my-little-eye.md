**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 681

**Lesson name:** I Spy with My Little Eye

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What can I see?

**Focus question image:**
Person in a safari hat peering through binoculars in tall grass.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students will observe and manipulate objects to identify the materials they are made of. They will recognise that tools like magnifying glasses enable more detailed observations, before making their own pair of ‘binoculars’. Through the reading of an eBook, students are introduced to a range of common materials used to make everyday objects. The idea that some objects are made from more than one material is introduced as students are asked to identify objects in the classroom that meet this criterion. The lesson culminates with a ‘Material Scavenger Hunt’ that provides an opportunity for students to practise their observational skills and apply their knowledge of materials. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and discuss what they see. Read the focus question,
'What can I see?' Ask students what the child might be looking at and why they
think that. Explain that in today's lesson they will be taking a close look at
different objects and thinking about the materials they are made from. Ask
students to share what they know about materials. Document and use the students’
responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify
any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Observe and manipulate objects to identify the materials they are made of.
- Success Criteria:
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that tools like binoculars/magnifying glasses enable more detailed
- observations.
- Recognise a range of common materials used to make objects.

**TEACHER READING:**
Materials are substances used to make objects and can be either natural or
synthetic. Natural materials come directly from nature and cannot be made by
humans. Examples include wood, cotton and wool. Synthetic materials are created
by people through chemical processes or by combining natural materials. Examples
include plastic and rubber.

Natural materials can be processed and transformed to create useful products.
For example, wood can be carved and polished to make furniture, while cotton can
be spun into yarn and woven into fabric. Synthetic materials, such as plastic,
can be moulded into various shapes to meet specific needs.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What can I see?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to identify the materials that objects are made of and recognise that
some objects are made of more than one type of material.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Read Honey and the Stickybeaks together. This original story introduces students
to a type of tool (binoculars) that enables a more detailed observation. After
reading, use the questions to engage students in a discussion about the book.
This critical-thinking activity requires students to consider what the metaphors
'heart of glass', 'heart of gold' and 'heart of stone' mean.
Students now have an opportunity to make their own binoculars. Assist them to
collect the materials they need and demonstrate each step of the process.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
The concept of objects being made from more than one type of material is now
introduced through the completion of an interactive matching game. After playing
the game, studentsThink, Pair, Share objects they can see in the classroom made
from more than one material.
Take the students on a guided walk throughout the school to complete a Materials
Scavenger Hunt. While students can pretend to use their binoculars, it is
recommended they are provided with magnifying glasses. This will enable them to
make more detailed observations. In pairs, students should photograph objects
made from a variety of different materials. These photos can be used later to
create a class display where students sort objects into different material
types.

Part 2 of 3

Students draw two objects they saw on their hunt and label the different
materials the objects are made of.

Part 3 of 3

Students draw two objects they saw on their hunt and label the different
materials the objects are made of.
Students are introduced to the idea that looking closely enables us to see what
things are made from. Read the eBook What Are Things Made From? to explicitly
teach students about some common materials that everyday objects are made from.
Complete the activity by providing time for students to use their binoculars to
look around the classroom and find objects made from materials they read about
in the eBook.
Taking the learning further, students now read about natural and made materials.
They then choose a natural material and draw three different things that can be
made from it.
Begin by showing the students the images provided. These images are designed to
help students understand that people often use special tools to observe things
more closely. Prompt the students to think about what these individuals might be
looking at and what tools they are using.
