**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 682

**Lesson name:** Observable Properties

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How are materials the same and different?

**Focus question image:**
Glass jar, plastic bottle, paper cup, and open tin can on a blue background.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students learn to sort and group materials based on observable properties. The lesson begins with an opportunity to explore sustainability as students use an interactive to sort different objects into recycling bins. An eBook supports students to explicitly learn a range of vocabulary for describing the properties of materials. They then apply this knowledge to explore materials using their senses. A collaborative sorting activity provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their ability to describe the different ways materials can be sorted and grouped.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Have students study the image and ask them to name the material each object is
made out of (glass, plastic, cardboard and metal). Read the focus question
together, 'How are materials the same and different?' Document and use the
studentsâ€™ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Sort and group materials based on observable properties.
- Success Criteria
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Know a range of vocabulary for describing the properties of materials.
- Use their senses to identify the observable properties of materials.
- Describe the different ways they sort and group materials.

**TEACHER READING:**
Materials are all around us and have different properties that make them useful
for various things.

Physical Properties

Materials can be heavy or light, depending on their density. For example, a rock
is heavy because it is dense, while a feather is light because it is not dense.
Some materials can melt, like ice, and some can't, like rocks. Materials can
also conduct heat, like metal, or insulate, like fabric. This means that metal
can feel hot or cold to the touch, while fabric can help keep us warm or cool.

What Materials Can Do

Some materials are strong and can hold heavy things, like wood or metal. They
can be used to build houses or bridges. Some materials can stretch, like rubber,
and some can't, like paper. This means that rubber can be used to make flexible
things like tyres or bands, while paper is better suited for writing or drawing.
Some materials can float, like wood, and some can sink, like rocks.

How Materials Look and Feel

Materials can be shiny, like metal, or dull, like cardboard. They can be smooth,
like glass, or rough, like sandpaper. Some materials are transparent, like
glass, which means we can see through them. Others are opaque, like wood, which
means we can't see through them. All these differences in how materials look and
feel make them useful for different things.

Exploring Materials with Our Senses

When we want to learn more about materials, we can use our senses to explore
them. By looking at materials, we can see their colour, shape and texture. We
can notice if they are transparent, opaque or reflective. By touching materials,
we can feel if they are smooth, rough, hot or cold. We can notice if they are
soft, hard or flexible. We can also listen to materials to hear if they make a
sound when tapped or moved.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How are materials the same and different?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an informal opportunity to assess a student's ability to sort
and group materials based on observable properties.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
This activity has been designed to introduce the concept of sorting and grouping
to students as they use the interactive to sort objects into different sorts of
materials. Depending on the availability of digital devices, this activity can
be done independently, in pairs or as a whole class.
Use the statement box to introduce the idea of materials having properties and
that these properties help us understand what materials are like. Read the
eBook, Properties of Materials, to explicitly teach the following properties:
soft, hard, shiny, dull, heavy, light, rough, smooth, flexible, transparent and
brittle. It may be beneficial to record these properties in a prominent area of
the classroom so they can be referred to throughout the lesson.
This hands-on activity provides an opportunity for students to explore materials
using their five senses. If needed, remind students of what the five senses are
and how we use them in our everyday life.

Place students in pairs and if possible provide them with an object made from a
single material. Ask students to discuss what material their object is made of.
Once students have correctly identified their material type, encourage them to
use their senses to explore the material's properties. Remind students that it
is not appropriate to use our sense of taste when exploring in Science and
Technology, as we may be handling materials that are poisonous to taste.

Part 2 of 2

Students should record their findings on the recording sheet, circling the
properties that apply to their material.

To complete the activity, ask students to buddy up with a pair who explored a
different material from them and have them compare how their materials are the
same and different.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
Addressing the misconception that materials can only be sorted in one way,
students play the Guess My Sorting Property game. Using either real objects or
the object cards provided, students first think about the material each object
is made from. They then take turns to sort some of the objects into two
different groups based on their properties. Provide an opportunity for each
student to have several goes at sorting.
Students independently draw and label two of their groups from the game.
This creative-thinking task requires students to use the property clues in the
riddles to identify which material the riddle is about. They then write their
own riddle about a material of their choosing.
Applying their critical-thinking skills, students consider whether the
statements about groups of objects are true or false. It may be beneficial for
students to cut each object out and physically experiment with creating the
groups. They can then use these groups to explain their thinking to a partner.
Taking the learning further, students now sort materials into groups based on
their properties. The first interactive requires them to sort the objects into
those made from smooth materials and those made from rough, while the second
interactive concentrates on the properties shiny and dull.
