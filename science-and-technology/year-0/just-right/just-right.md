**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 683

**Lesson name:** Just Right

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Why is it made that way?

**Focus question image:**
Desk with stationery, books, and a pencil case in front of a chalkboard with mathematical equations.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students recognise the need for some objects to be composed of different materials. They will listen to the story of Goldilocks and The Three Bears and identify how materials are suited for different uses. Students explore how First Nations Peoples of Australia use different materials to make objects. They learn about the origins of two special First Nations objects, discussing the materials they are made of and why they think those materials were chosen. The lesson culminates with an opportunity for students to locate objects in their environment that are made of more than one material, drawing and labelling one of the objects they find.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image and discuss what they see. Ask them to name an object
and the material they think it is made of. Using the focus question as a
provocation, ask students to suggest why the object has been made using that
material. Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Recognise the need for some objects to be composed of different materials.
- Success Criteria
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that some objects are made from more than one material.
- Identify the materials an object is made from.
- Suggest why different parts of objects are made from different materials.

**TEACHER READING:**
When selecting a material for creating an object, evaluating several properties
is crucial to ensure the material meets the desired function and durability.
Important properties include strength, flexibility, weight and resistance to
heat and water. Additionally, hardness, texture and ease of shaping or moulding
are key factors. Careful selection of the most appropriate material ensures the
object will perform well and last.

First Nations Peoples of Australia have long used their knowledge of the natural
world to choose the right materials for their tools and objects. For instance,
they used hard woods, such as mulga or wattle, to craft spears and digging
sticks because these woods are tough and can withstand heavy use.

For making containers to carry water, they selected materials that were
naturally waterproof or could be easily shaped and sealed. Bark from trees like
the stringybark or coolamon were often used to make bowls or carrying dishes.
They also used animal skins to create water bags, understanding that certain
skins would hold water without leaking.

This careful selection of materials based on their properties allowed First
Nations Peoples to live sustainably, using resources in a way that respected the
environment and met their needs efficiently.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why is it made that way?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kind of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to recognise that objects can be composed of different materials and
suggest reasons why.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
The story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears is used to engage students and
prompt them to consider how the same object can be made from different
materials. After watching the animated story, students participate in a Think,
Pair, Share activity to discuss the differences between the three bears' chairs.
Finish the activity by asking students to share their reasoning on why they
believe Goldilocks preferred Baby Bear's chair.
Taking the learning further, students explore two images of greenhouses. They
identify the materials used to make greenhouses and reason about why these
materials are good materials to use. They complete the activity by drawing what
they think the inside of a greenhouse might look like.
This activity addresses the key understanding that using different materials
together can help an object work better and last longer. Students identify the
materials used to make a chair and consider why different materials have been
used for the legs and seat.
This activity provides an opportunity for students to explore how First Nations
Peoples of Australia use their understanding of the properties of materials to
make objects. Students are shown a hand-drawn image of a type of knife typically
made by First Nations Peoples of Australia. Tell students that the knife has
been made by combining two different types of materials: quartzite (a type of
rock) for the blade and wood for the handle. Ask students to share why they
think rock and wood were used to make the knife.

Part 2 of 2

Students now learn how First Nations Peoples used a special bucket called a
tarnuk to carry water when they travelled. Share with students that the tarnuk
is made from wood, in some cases the hollowed out burl of a river red gum, with
a strong handle made from the inner bark of the stringybark tree. It may be
beneficial to show students images of both these trees to support understanding.
Discuss how the bottom of the bucket was often sealed with clay. Ask students to
reason about why those materials were chosen.
Use the statement box to introduce the idea that when designing and making
objects, it is important to consider their purpose. Using the visual of
different chairs, students consider an activity they might do while sitting in
each chair and why the chair is good for that activity.
Students think about an object they know that is made from more than one type of
material. They name the object, list its uses and complete a drawing of it,
labelling the materials it is made from. Depending on their ability, students
then either verbally explain or write about why they think the object is made
from these materials, using their understanding of the materials' properties.
Applying their critical-thinking skills, students consider what is good, bad and
interesting about making furniture out of cardboard.

PART 1:
[Statement Box] For thousands of years, First Nations Peoples of Australia have been using
different materials to make objects. They know that different parts of an object
need different materials to do their jobs well.
[Statement Box] This drawing is an example of a type of knife that First Nations Peoples might
make by combining different materials together. Quartzite (a type of rock) would
be used to make the blade and wood would be used to make the handle.
[Discussion] Why do you think rock and wood were used to make the knife?
[Image] An illustration of a knife, used by First Nations Peoples. It has a wooden handle and a blade made from quartzite (a type of rock).

PART 2:
[Statement Box] A long time ago, First Nations Peoples used a special bucket called a tarnuk to
carry water when they travelled. The women would fill it with water from creeks
or waterholes and carry it with them. The bucket would be made from wood and the
handle made from rope, and sometimes clay would be used to seal the bottom of
the bucket. 
[Discussion] Why do you think those materials were chosen?
[Image] A tarnuk made by First Nations Peoples. It is a bucket made from clay with a rope handle.
