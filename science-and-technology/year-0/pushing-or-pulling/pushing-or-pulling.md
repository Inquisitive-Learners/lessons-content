**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 684

**Lesson name:** Pushing or Pulling?

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How can it move?

**Focus question image:**
Three children playing with a sledge in the snow, one pulling while the others ride and push.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students explore push and pull forces through interactive activities. They begin by making funny faces, identifying whether they are using a push, pull or both. Students then engage with a Push or Pull interactive, acting out movements and sorting them accordingly. Next, students examine photos of push and pull in everyday activities and discuss how these forces affect objects. Using playdough, they create a ball and change its shape by pushing and pulling it, drawing their observations. The lesson concludes with a hands-on exploration where students identify objects that can be pushed or pulled, documenting their findings through drawings or descriptions.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image of the children playing on the sled. Read the focus
question, 'How can it move?' Ask students how they think the sled moves.
Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their current
understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Understand how push and pull forces can change the shape or movement of
- objects in their environment.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand that pushes move objects away and pulls move objects towards them.
- Correctly categorise motions as pushes or pulls.
- Find and identify objects in their environment that can be pushed or pulled.
- Explain how a push or pull can change an object’s shape or movement.
- Draw an object that can be both pushed and pulled and demonstrate how it is
- moved in both directions.

**TEACHER READING:**
A force is a push or pull that can change the movement or shape of an object.
Forces are essential in our daily lives and are responsible for making objects
move, stop, change direction or alter their shape. Pushes and pulls are two
types of forces that are easy for young students to observe and understand
through play and interaction with their surroundings.

A push is a force that moves an object away from the source of the force. Common
examples of a push include closing a door, kicking a ball or pushing a toy
across the floor. Pushes often result in an object moving away from the person
or object applying the force.

A pull is a force that moves an object towards the source of the force. Examples
of a pull include opening a drawer, pulling a wagon or lifting a bag. Pulls
cause objects to move towards the person or object applying the force.

Pushes and pulls can work together. For instance, when opening a door, you may
pull the handle to open it, and when closing it, you push it shut. Similarly,
objects like a rope in tug-of-war or a toy car often involve both pushes and
pulls acting together to create movement.

Forces also affect the shape of objects, especially softer materials. When
students use playdough, pushing can flatten or compress it, while pulling can
stretch or elongate it. This shows that forces can not only move objects but
also change their form.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How can it move?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions from the
beginning of the lesson.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.
Be aware of students' allergies when using playdough.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to understand how push and pull forces can change the shape or movement
of objects in their environment.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Explain that things move because of a push or pull force and that a push moves
an object away from you, and a pull moves an object towards you. Draw students'
attention to the Push or Pull interactive. As each video appears, have students
act out the movement, before sorting it into a push or a pull.
This question asks students to think about the possibility that an object can be
moved by using both a push and a pull. Have students talk with a partner or in a
small group about all of the objects they have explored through pushes and
pulls. Allow them to test their ideas on some classroom objects (safe ones). Ask
students to draw an object that they can both push and pull, and to show how it
is pushed or pulled. (They might like to do two drawings.)
This activity requires students to apply their creative thinking as they
consider how they can move the block without using their hands. Having a block
and materials such as string, a paddle pop stick, a straw and a crayon available
may serve as useful visual prompts. Have partners or small groups use the
materials to either push or pull the block. Have volunteers share their ideas,
before students draw or write about them.
This exploration can be done in the classroom or outdoors in a playground area.
Encourage students to find as many objects as they can that can be either pushed
or pulled. Point out any items that may be dangerous when pushed or pulled
(e.g., bookcases), and instruct students not to touch them. Have students draw
or write about objects they found.
Show students the two videos. As a class, discuss the funny faces they can make
and encourage them to share their funny faces with a partner or small group. Ask
students if they are using a push or a pull to make their funny face. (If there
is more than one action, they may be using both.) Remind them to not touch other
students’ faces while participating in this activity.

Have students look at the photos of push and pull being used in everyday
activities. Explain that a push or a pull can change objects. Talk about what is
happening in the pictures, and then have students answer the questions.
Provide students with Play-Doh and ask them to make a ball. Encourage them to
push and pull it to change its shape.
