**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 1049

**Lesson name:** Moving Through the Air

**Lesson duration:** 60 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** How is it made to move?

**Focus question image:**
Two paper aeroplanes flying in a clear blue sky with scattered clouds.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students investigate how materials and shapes influence movement. They begin by watching a Zorb ball video, discussing its material choice. Students then predict and test which of four balls (basketball, golf ball, tennis ball, marble) will bounce highest, learning how materials affect bouncing. Next, they compare a paper plane and a block plane to explore how shapes affect flight. They analyse aeroplanes and javelins, noting how narrow, pointed shapes help movement. Students also examine First Nations toys for similar design features. The lesson ends with students drawing objects that bounce or fly, explaining their movement to a partner. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Show students the image of the paper planes. Ask them the focus question, 'How
is it made to move?' Encourage students to talk about what the planes are made
of and how they have been made. Document and use the students’ responses to help
gauge their current understanding of the topic and to identify any
misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Explore and explain how the material and shape of an object affects how it
- moves.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Identify that different materials (e.g. plastic, rubber, glass) affect the
- bounce of a ball.
- Compare the shape and material of objects to understand how they influence
- movement.
- Recognise that a long, pointy shape helps objects move effectively through
- the air.
- Describe how traditional First Nations Peoples' toys and modern objects like
- a javelin share similar aerodynamic designs.
- Use observation to explain how material and shape impact the movement of
- objects like a Zorb ball and a spear/javelin.

**TEACHER READING:**
The type of material an object is made of affects how it bounces. Rubber, being
more elastic, tends to store and release energy more efficiently, resulting in a
higher bounce compared to plastic. The shape of an object also matters,
affecting how it moves through the air. Objects with smooth and streamlined
shapes, like balls or cones, are designed to move easily through the air with
less resistance.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * How is it made to move?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to explain how the material and shape of an object affects how it moves.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students watch the Zorb Balls video again. They consider what kind of material
the Zorb balls are made of and why they think the balls are made of this
material. Students may recognise that it is a smooth material, easy to roll,
waterproof and tough. Encourage them to think of why this is important.
Students view four familiar types of balls: a basketball, a golf ball, a tennis
ball and a marble. Allow them to only look at the objects, identifying their
external features, size and purpose. Students discuss how the objects are the
same and different.
Provide students with the opportunity to watch their videos again, before using
the sorting tool to sort the balls from the most to least bouncy. Finish the
activity by discussing why they think there is a difference in bounce.
Place students in groups of four and provide each group with the different ball
types (basketball, golf ball, tennis ball and marble). Explain that they will be
dropping each ball from waist-height and video recording the results.

Before they begin ask students to predict which ball will bounce the highest.
Encourage them to share their reasoning with each other. Once students have made
their predictions, they complete the investigation.
Tell students that the balls bounce differently because they are made of
different materials.

Direct students' attention to the close-up shot of a marble, telling them that a
marble is usually made of glass or hard plastic. A marble bounces a little
because when it hits the ground, it squishes just a tiny bit and then pushes
back up.

Then direct students attention to the close-up shot of a basketball. A
basketball bounces well because it's filled with air, allowing it to push back
after hitting the ground. Its rubber material also helps it spring back quickly,
making it easy to bounce.

Have students feel the texture of the balls and pay more attention to what
materials they may be made of.

-- Possible lesson-break point --
Share with students that the material that something is made of can affect the
way it moves. Direct their attention to the two different planes and ask what is
the same and different. Encourage students to think about the materials used to
make each. Finish the activity by discussing which they think would fly and why.

Optional activity: Have the students try and make a paper plane and a block
plane, and safely test them.
Explain to students that the shape of an object can affect how it moves. Have
them observe four different images of things that fly: an airplane, a rocket, an
arrow, and a javelin. Discuss what these objects have in common and encourage
students to closely examine the shape of the front end of each one. Point out
that all have pointed ends and are narrow in shape. Ask students why they think
this is the case.
Use this page to give students background information about the objects they
saw.
Watch the video Javelin Throw. Tell students that a javelin is a type of spear
used for sport. Have students watch the video again and try to imitate the
movements seen. Students use their arms to show how the javelin is thrown and
how the javelin moves through the air. 
Students consider two balls: a bowling ball and a soccer ball, both of which are
similar in size. They think critically about which ball they could kick the
farthest, explaining their reasoning.
Have students reflect on the lesson activities by drawing an object that can
bounce and an object that can fly. Provide an opportunity for them to share
their objects with a partner, explaining why their chosen objects bounce or fly.
Explain to students that a long, straight shape with a pointy end will move
through the air best. Use the link to look at First Nations Australians' toys.
Explore each toy thoroughly using the See, Think, Wonder visible thinking
routine. Support students to identify which objects are similar to what they
observed in the previous activity.
Students imagine living in a time before modern materials like plastic or
rubber. They think about what natural materials from the environment could be
used to create a ball or spear, drawing and labelling their ideas.

**PRACTICAL TIPS:**
For safety reasons, have students conduct their investigation on a soft surface
such as a carpet.
