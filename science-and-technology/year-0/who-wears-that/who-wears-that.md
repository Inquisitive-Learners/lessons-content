**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 1048

**Lesson name:** Who Wears That?

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** Why do we wear different things?

**Focus question image:**
Various hats: hard hat, sun hat, fedora, shower cap, swim cap with goggles, and a red knitted beanie.

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students conduct an investigation into the observable properties of materials. The lesson begins with a fun interactive What’s Happening in the City? where students digitally explore the different types of protective clothing worn by people doing different jobs and activities. A practical investigation to determine which materials are waterproof is undertaken, with students making predictions about the properties of materials and using their senses to make observations. The lesson culminates with students deciding which is the most suitable material for making a raincoat.

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
Draw students' attention to the image and discuss what they see. Ask them if
they own any hats like this and when might they wear each type of hat. Read the
focus question, 'Why do we wear different things?' Document and use the
students’ responses to help gauge their current understanding of the topic and
to identify any misconceptions.

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Conduct an investigation into the observable properties of materials.
- Success Criteria
- By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Make predictions about the properties of materials.
- Use their senses when making observations.
- Revisit their prediction, reflecting on whether it matched their
- observations.
- Share their observations and ideas with others.

**TEACHER READING:**
Protective clothing is designed to safeguard individuals from potential hazards
in various environments and serves a range of specific purposes. Gloves prevent
skin contact with chemicals, biological agents or sharp objects. Goggles protect
eyes from chemical splashes, dust or debris. Masks filter airborne particles,
preventing inhalation of hazardous substances. Aprons shield clothing from
stains and splashes. Safety vests enhance visibility in low-light conditions.
Closed-toe shoes prevent foot injuries from heavy objects or hot surfaces.

Protective clothing is made from a range of materials, each with unique
properties. Cotton is breathable, absorbent and suitable for general-purpose
protection. Synthetic fibres are resistant to chemicals, abrasion and heat.
Rubber is impermeable to liquids, making it ideal for gloves and aprons.

Children may wear protective clothing in their daily lives without even
realising it. For example, they wear helmets while riding bicycles or scooters
to protect their heads from impact. They may wear knee and elbow pads while
skateboarding or rollerblading to prevent scrapes and bruises. Additionally,
children may wear sunscreen and hats to protect their skin from the Sun's
harmful rays. Even wearing closed-toe shoes while playing outside can protect
their feet from sharp objects or hot surfaces. By recognising these everyday
examples, children can develop a better understanding of the importance of
protective clothing.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * Why do we wear different things?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson.

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to conduct an investigation about the observable properties of
materials.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Designed to provoke thinking about protective clothing, students explore the
What's Happening in the City? interactive. Using the magnifying glass, they
identify 12 different people, noting the jobs they are doing and the protective
clothing they are wearing.
Use the statement box to explain why people might wear protective clothing.
Connect the learning to the students' daily lives by asking them to share a time
when they have worn protective clothing.
Using the context of determining which material is best for a raincoat, students
now conduct an investigation into the observable properties of materials.

Place students into small groups before assisting them to collect the materials
they need. It is recommended that the following materials are used:

 * Nylon or polyester from something waterproof, like an old umbrella, sleeping
   bag or wet-weather jacket

 * Cotton from an old t-shirt

 * Wool/acrylic or another synthetic fabric

Part 2 of 4

Read each step of the investigation, providing time for students to complete the
step before moving on. Students should feel each piece of material and share
what properties they think it has. They then make a prediction about which will
stop the water going through to the paper and why they think that. The
vocabulary 'waterproof' could be introduced to students at this point, if deemed
appropriate.

Part 3 of 4

Students work through the final three steps of the investigation, with each
group member taking a turn at testing their paper person with a different
material.

Part 4 of 4

Students record if their prediction was correct and draw the piece of material
that stopped the water going through. Based on their observations, they explain
which material raincoats should be made of and why, before drawing some other
objects they think should be made of this material.
Students apply their creative-thinking skills and knowledge of materials and
their properties to state which material they think would be best for making a
superhero cape and why they think that. They complete the activity by drawing
and labelling their cape.
Building on what students have learnt in the lesson, introduce the idea of
protective clothing for animals. Students design and label a new type of
protective clothing for an animal of their choice. They then explain how their
design will protect their animal.
