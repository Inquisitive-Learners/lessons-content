**Year:** Foundation

**Lesson ID:** 458

**Lesson name:** What is a Living Thing?

**Lesson duration:** 80 minutes.

**FOCUS QUESTION:** What is a living thing?

**Focus question image:**

**TEACHER READING NOTES:**
In this lesson, students identify what characterises a living thing. They are explicitly taught what a living thing is and apply this understanding to sort familiar living and non-living things. A guided walk provides an opportunity for students to identify living and non-living things in their school environment. They work collaboratively to photograph, draw and sort what they find, demonstrating their understanding of the differences between living and non-living. 

**LESSON INTRODUCTION:**
To stimulate interest and curiosity, ask students what they can see in the image
and what they think the child is doing. Pose the focus question, ‘What is a
living thing?’ Document and use the students’ responses to help gauge their
current understanding of the topic and to identify any misconceptions. 

**LEARNING INTENTIONS:**
Students are learning to:
- Characterise familiar things as living or non-living.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Know that a living thing grows, eats, moves and can make more of itself.
- Sort familiar things into living or non-living.
- Identify living and non-living things in the school environment.

**TEACHER READING:**
Living things are organisms that exhibit the characteristics of life. These
characteristics include growth, reproduction, response to stimuli and
metabolism. Living things can be plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and other
microorganisms. They require basic needs like food, water, air and shelter to
survive.

Non-living things do not exhibit the characteristics of life. They do not grow,
reproduce or respond to stimuli. Non-living things can be natural, like rocks
and water, or man-made, like toys and furniture. Non-living things remain
unchanged unless acted upon by an external force.

**ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE:**
As a class activity, revisit the focus question:

 * What is a living thing?

Ask students to share their ideas, addressing any misconceptions that still
exist.

**NOTES:**
Vocabulary Words

The vocabulary words in this lesson are defined as Tier 3 words, which are
low-frequency, subject-specific words. The instruction for these kinds of words
should focus on building content knowledge within the lesson. The vocabulary
words appear in bold within the lesson. 

**ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS:**
This activity is an opportunity to make an informal assessment of a student's
ability to characterise familiar things as living or non-living.

**EXPLANATIONS:**
Students watch the Living or Non-Living video which tests their ability to
differentiate between living and non-living things via an engaging game show
format. It may be beneficial for students to watch the video more than once. The
first time for enjoyment and the second time to answer the questions:

 * What living things did you see?

 * Can you think of some more living things?
Students learn that living things can grow, change, and move on their own, and
that all living things need air, water and food to stay alive. While non-living
things do not grow, breathe or need food.

Some students may have the misconception that plants do not move. To address
this, discuss how plants and trees move, but they do it very slowly, so it's
hard to see with your eyes. Use the image of the sunflowers to model how they
move toward the light from the Sun to help them grow strong. Even though they
don’t move like animals do, they still change their shape and grow in different
directions to get what they need to stay healthy.

Students complete the sorting activity to consolidate and demonstrate their
understanding of living and non-living things. Encourage students to verbalise
their thinking process, justifying why they categorise each item as living or
non-living. This will help reinforce their understanding and build their
critical thinking skills.
Tell students they will be going on a guided walk around the school to look for
living and non-living things. Using the images on the page to provoke
discussion, ask students to share where they think they might see living and
non-living things.

Part 2 of 3

During the walk, have the students actively participate by taking photos or
drawing pictures of the living and non-living things they find. This will not
only engage them but also help them document their findings for further
discussion in class. Offer guidance on observing differences and similarities
between items found. This part of the activity builds on their inquiry skills by
allowing them to investigate their environment directly.

Part 3 of 3

Once back in the classroom, students draw the living and non-living things they
observed, drawing blue circles around the living things and red circles around
the non-living things. This visual differentiation will help consolidate their
learning.
This challenging activity prompts students to critically think about whether a
freshly picked flower is living or non-living.
For this deeper learning activity, students consider how living things can be
found everywhere. They complete the Venn diagram by drawing living things that
can be found on land, in water, or both.

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**

  Materials: Camera (or a device with a camera), Clipboard, Hand lens

Differentiation: Green Circle - The green circle represents core activities. They are central to the focus question or learning intention and include surface, deeper and transfer of learning.
Duration: 5 minutes

**ACTIVITY 2:**
Description: Students learn that living things can grow, change and move on their own, and
that all living things need air, water and food to stay alive. Meanwhile,
non-living things do not grow, breathe or need food.

Some students may have the misconception that plants do not move. To address
this, discuss how plants and trees move, but they do it very slowly, so it's
hard to see with your eyes. Use the image of the sunflowers to model how they

non-living. This will help reinforce their understanding and build their
critical thinking skills.
